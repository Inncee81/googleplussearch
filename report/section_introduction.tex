\section{Introduction}
We developed an offline google search engine with a database which is retrieved from internet in google+ communities. The documents are user profiles and user posts. The user profile contains basic information like gender, about me, relationship status, and place where user lives. The user posts contain some information of user id and text on with some topics. We implemented IR and data mining tasks using those documents.

\subsection*{Motivation}
Humans are social creatures. It’s a natural thing to interested in another person. One way to fulfill this interest is by using social media like Google+. Google+ contains interesting information for some people such as user profiles and posts, but how do people find this information? By using search engine! \\
The main motivation of this project is to be able to query Google+ data by retrieving interesting information from user profiles and posts. Using information retrieval and data mining techniques it is possible to build a Google+ search engine.

\subsection*{Goal}
The project goal is to build a search engine that is capable of retrieving user profiles and posts from an offline database containing Google+ data. The queries are based on general interests, query by example and keywords.
