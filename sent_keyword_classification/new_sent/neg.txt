A direct-to-void release , heading nowhere
for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes

alarming
... unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted .

possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything
post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .

indoctrinated prejudice
ever so wrong
ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up
movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics
motion picture that wo n't make much of a splash when it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards
If I had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong

a non-starter
It 's fairly self-aware in its dumbness .
too long and unfocused
period trappings
performing in a film that is only mildly diverting
merely lacks everything except good intentions
merely quirky
a big-budget , after-school special
a bit repetitive
a bit tedious
darker turns

there 's no art here
ad I suffered and bled on the hard ground of Ia Drang
add to the confusion
this stuck pig
recovering from its demented premise
it begins to fade from memory
this turgid
it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
its excessive moral baggage
a heavy stench of ` been there , done

new movie rapes
big , brassy , disturbing ,
errant
a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord
vague without any of its sense of fun or energy
Like a grinning Jack O ' Lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .

... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .

A superfluous sequel ...
like one of ( Spears ' ) music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it
A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
A superfluous sequel
A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone
The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . I tried to read the time on my watch .
The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .

, the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
, the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek 's novel by some way . It settles for being merely grim .
, the film loses credibility .
, the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
, the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
, the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
, the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
, the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
