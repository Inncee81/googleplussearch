I liked the movie, though. I&#39;m not too crazy about &quot;Smilin&#39; Through&quot; either.

There are some special families who are believed to have banshees attached to them, and whose cries herald the death of a member of that family.

Mentions of banshees can also be found in Norman literature of that time. The Ban Si was also known to wail at the crowning of the true king. Such a cry was reported to be heard at the crowning of Brian Boru. Traditionally, when a person died a woman would sing a lament (in Irish: caoineadh, [\u02c8k\u0270i\u02d0n\u02b2\u0259] or [\u02c8ki\u02d0n\u02b2u\u02d0], &quot;caoin&quot; meaning &quot;to weep, to wail&quot;) at the funeral.

The \u00d3 Briains&#39; banshee was thought to have the name of Eevul, and was ruler of 25 other banshees who would always be at her attendance. It is thought that from this myth comes the idea that the wailing of numerous banshees signifies the death of a great person. In later versions, the banshee might appear before the death and warn the family by wailing. When several banshees appeared at once, it indicated the death of someone great or holy.

G is for Golem One of my favorite supernatural entities as it is for the defense of the people. In Jewish folklore, a golem (/\u02c8\u0261o\u028al\u0259m/ goh-l\u0259m; Hebrew: \u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd\u200e) is an animated anthropomorphic being, created entirely from inanimate matter. The word was used to mean an amorphous, unformed material in Psalms and medieval writing. The most famous golem narrative involves Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the late-16th-century rabbi of Prague. There are many tales differing on how the Golem was brought to life and afterwards controlled. History Etymology The word golem occurs once in the Bible in Psalms 139:16, which uses the word \u05d2\u05dc\u05de\u05d9 (galmi; my golem), meaning &quot;my unshaped form&quot;, connoting the unfinished human being before God\u2019s eyes. The Mishnah uses the term for an uncultivated person: &quot;Seven characteristics are in an uncultivated person, and seven in a learned one,&quot; (\u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd) (Pirkei Avot 5:6 in the Hebrew text; English translations vary). In Modern Hebrew, golem is used to mean &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;helpless&quot;. Similarly, it is often used today as a metaphor for a brainless lunk or entity who serves man under controlled conditions but is hostile to him under others. &quot;Golem&quot; passed into Yiddish as goylem to mean someone who is clumsy or slow. Earliest Stories The earliest stories of golems date to early Judaism. In the Talmud (Tractate Sanhedrin 38b), Adam was initially created as a golem (\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd) when his dust was &quot;kneaded into a shapeless husk.&quot; Like Adam, all golems are created from mud. They were a creation of those who were very holy and close to God. A very holy person was one who strove to approach God, and in that pursuit would gain some of God&#39;s wisdom and power. One of these powers was the creation of life. However, no matter how holy a person became, a being created by that person would be but a shadow of one created by God. Early on, it was noted that the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. Sanhedrin 65b describes Rava creating a man (gavra). He sent the man to Rav Zeira. Rav Zeira spoke to him, but he did not answer. Rav Zeira said, &quot;You were created by the magicians; return to your dust.&quot; During the Middle Ages, passages from the Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation) were studied as a means to attain the mystical ability to create and animate a golem, although there is little in the writings of Jewish mysticism that supports this belief. It was believed that golems could be activated by an ecstatic experience induced by the ritualistic use of various letters of the Hebrew Alphabet[1] forming a &quot;shem&quot; (any one of the Names of God). The shem was written on a piece of paper and inserted either in the mouth or in the forehead of the golem, thus bringing it into life and action. In some tales, (for example, some versions of those of the golems of Che\u0142m and Prague, as well as in Polish tales and version of Brothers Grimm), a golem is inscribed with Hebrew words, such as the word emet (\u05d0\u05de\u05ea, &quot;truth&quot; in the Hebrew language) written on its forehead. The golem could then be deactivated by removing the aleph (\u05d0) in emet,[5] thus changing the inscription from &#39;truth&#39; to &#39;death&#39; (met \u05de\u05ea, meaning &quot;dead&quot;). Other versions add that after creating an entity out of clay, it would be brought to life by placing into his mouth a shem with a magic formula, and could later be immobilized by pulling out the shem, or by reversing the creative combinations, for, as Rabbi Jacob ben Shalom, who arrived at Barcelona from Germany in 1325, remarked, the law of destruction is the reversal of the law of creation. Joseph Delmedigo informs us, in 1625, that &quot;many legends of this sort are current, particularly in Germany.&quot; The earliest known written account of how to create a golem can be found in Sodei Razayya by Eleazar ben Judah of Worms (1165-1230). The Golem of Chelm See also: Elijah Ba&#39;al Shem of Chelm The oldest description of the creation of a golem by a historical figure is included in a tradition connected to Rabbi Eliyahu of Che\u0142m (1550\u20131583). Moshe Idel comments, &quot;This tradition in one form or another is the blueprint of the later legend of the creation of the Golem by Eliayahu&#39;s famous contemporary R. Yehudah Loew of Prague&quot; (= R. Judah Loew ben Bezalel; &quot;Judah&quot; is the English form of the Hebrew name \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4 &quot;Yehudah&quot;.) A Polish Kabbalist, writing in about 1630\u20131650, reported the creation of a golem by Rabbi Eliyahu thus: &quot;And I have heard, in a certain and explicit way, from several respectable persons that one man [living] close to our time, whose name is R. Eliyahu, the master of the name, who made a creature out of matter [Heb. Golem] and form [Heb. tzurah] and it performed hard work for him, for a long period, and the name of emet was hanging upon his neck, until he finally removed it for a certain reason, the name from his neck and it turned to dust.&quot; A similar account was reported by a Christian author, Christoph Arnold, in 1674. Rabbi Jacob Emden (d. 1776) elaborated on the story in a book published in 1748: &quot;As an aside, I&#39;ll mention here what I heard from my father&#39;s holy mouth regarding the Golem created by his ancestor, the Gaon R. Eliyahu Ba&#39;al Shem of blessed memory. When the Gaon saw that the Golem was growing larger and larger, he feared that the Golem would destroy the universe. He then removed the Holy Name that was embedded on his forehead, thus causing him to disintegrate and return to dust. Nonetheless, while he was engaged in extracting the Holy Name from him, the Golem injured him, scarring him on the face.&quot; According to the Polish Kabbalist, &quot;the legend was known to several persons, thus allowing us to speculate that the legend had indeed circulated for some time before it was committed to writing and, consequently, we may assume that its origins are to be traced to the generation immediately following the death of R. Eliyahu, if not earlier.&quot;", "replyCount": 9, "cleanContent": "A little Halloween alphabet... G is for Golem One of my favorite supernatural entities as it is for the defense of the people. In Jewish folklore, a golem (/\u02c8\u0261o\u028al\u0259m/ goh-l\u0259m; Hebrew: \u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd\u200e) is an animated anthropomorphic being, created entirely from inanimate matter. The word was used to mean an amorphous, unformed material in Psalms and medieval writing. The most famous golem narrative involves Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the late-16th-century rabbi of Prague. There are many tales differing on how the Golem was brought to life and afterwards controlled. History Etymology The word golem occurs once in the Bible in Psalms 139:16, which uses the word \u05d2\u05dc\u05de\u05d9 (galmi; my golem), meaning \"my unshaped form\", connoting the unfinished human being before God\u2019s eyes. The Mishnah uses the term for an uncultivated person: \"Seven characteristics are in an uncultivated person, and seven in a learned one,\" (\u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd) (Pirkei Avot 5:6 in the Hebrew text; English translations vary). In Modern Hebrew, golem is used to mean \"dumb\" or \"helpless\". Similarly, it is often used today as a metaphor for a brainless lunk or entity who serves man under controlled conditions but is hostile to him under others. \"Golem\" passed into Yiddish as goylem to mean someone who is clumsy or slow.

The woman will stop the child and ask, \"Am I pretty?\" If the child answers no, the child is killed with a pair of scissors which the woman carries. If the child answers yes, the woman pulls away the mask, revealing that her mouth is slit from ear to ear, and asks \"How about now?\" If the child answers no, he/she will be cut in half. If the child answers yes, then she will slit his/her mouth like hers. It is impossible to run away from her, as she will simply reappear in front of the victim. When the legend reappeared in the 1970s rumors of ways to escape also emerged. Some sources say she can also be confused by answering her question with, rather than yes or no, \"You are average.\" Unsure of what to do, she will give a person enough time to escape while she is lost in thought. Another escape route is to tell her one has a previous engagement; she will pardon her manners and excuse herself. In some variations of the tale, she can be distracted by fruit or candies thrown at her which she will then pick up, thus giving the victim a chance to run. She will also be at an advantage to run toward you if she has the chance. Another way is for the child to ask her if the child is pretty; she will get confused and leave.", "sentiment_score": -0.03173719376391982, "postID": "z12bdf0wjx32dfyvd23bhnmomlz4efsbb04"}

I have something urgent to discuss&quot; it said. Before I even reached my car, I called Steve Jobs back. I was responsible for all mobile applications at Google, and in that role, had regular dealings with Steve. It was one of the perks of the job. &quot;Hey Steve - this is Vic&quot;, I said. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t answer your call earlier. I was in religious services, and the caller ID said unknown, so I didn&#39;t pick up&quot;. Steve laughed.

I wondered what was so important? &quot;So Vic, we have an urgent issue, one that I need addressed right away.

But in the end, when I think about leadership, passion and attention to detail, I think back to the call I received from Steve Jobs on a Sunday morning in January.

But a study back in 1999 ( http://goo.gl/YQkfWO ) suggested that hummingbirds don&#39;t like red so much as they like nectar. \u00a0The authors hybridized a range of monkeyflowers that differed among a number of traits, including colour, size/shape, and nectar production. Researchers then recorded the number of times bumblebees and hummingbirds visited each type of flower - out of a total of more than 12,500 visits. Nectar production tended to be the key factor in attracting hummingbirds rather than colour. So where does the idea that hummingbirds like red come from? It turns out that the bees happened not to like red flowers so much, which would mean that in the wild those flowers would be more likely to have more nectar for hummingbirds.\u00a0 *What hummingbirds drink Hummingbirds expend a huge amount of energy throughout their day, as you would too if you flapped your wings 90 times per second and had a heart rate on the order of 1200 beat per minute - about 15-20 times faster than a typical human heart. Research suggests that the characteristic hovering of hummingbirds requires about 15 times the energy that would be required by perching (Hainsworth and Wolf, 1993: http://goo.gl/lup4Ra ). The nectar that hummingbirds feast on to make up that energy is a combination of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, along with small amounts of protein and minerals (most of the protein hummingbirds consume comes via small insects, rather than through nectar). But different species of plants have different level of sugar concentration, and hummingbirds will eat more frequently if the flowers they visit have lower concentrations, to make sure they end up with enough energy to survive. Of course, as the study described above suggests, hummingbirds will prefer high energy sources, so if you wear the Hummingbird Feeder Mask, be sure you have a good sugar concentration there to attract the birds. *How hummingbirds drink Many people think that hummingbirds drink by using their tongue as a straw, and just sucking up the nectar through it. But a recent study suggested that hummingbird tongues actually curl around the nectar to pull it in. Alejndro Rico-Guervara and Margaret Rubega developed see through flowers through which they could film high-speed videos of the hummingbird&#39;s drinking action at high levesl of magnification.

Although scientists still haven&#39;t fully determined the physics behind hummingbird drinking, as Mosher describes, that understanding could have practical implications for a range of areas including development of liquid drinking robots, fluid-powered microchips, of even more efficient sponges and mops. *What goes in, must come out Regardless of which flowers are giving hummingbirds their nectar, hummingbirds drink an awful lot of it each day - exactly how much depends on the sugar content in nectar, but it can be more than 10 times their body weight. So where does all that nectar go?

Composed of interstellar gas and dust, the grouping of light-year sized cometary globules is about 1300 light-years distant. Energetic ultraviolet light from nearby hot stars has molded the globules and ionized their bright rims.

Alternating Current - A war was leveled between the vision of Edison and the vision of Tesla for how electricity would be produced and distributed. The division can be summarized as one of cost and safety: Tesla demonstrated that AC was perfectly safe by famously shooting current through his own body to produce light. Tesla&#39;s system that provides power generation and distribution to North America in our modern era. 2. Light -Of course he didn&#39;t invent light itself, but he did invent how light can be harnessed and distributed. Tesla developed and used florescent bulbs in his lab some 40 years before industry &quot;invented&quot; them. At the World&#39;s Fair, Tesla took glass tubes and bent them into famous scientists&#39; names, in effect creating the first neon signs. However, it is his Tesla Coil that might be the most impressive, and controversial. The Tesla Coil is certainly something that big industry would have liked to suppress: the concept that the Earth itself is a magnet that can generate electricity (electromagnetism) utilizing frequencies as a transmitter. 3. X-rays - Electromagnetic and ionizing radiation was heavily researched in the late 1800s, but Tesla researched the entire gamut. Everything from a precursor to Kirlian photography, which has the ability to document life force, to what we now use in medical diagnostics, this was a transformative invention of which Tesla played a central role. 4. Radio -- Guglielmo Marconi was initially credited, and most believe him to be the inventor of radio to this day. However, the Supreme Court overturned Marconi&#39;s patent in 1943, when it was proven that Tesla invented the radio years previous to Marconi. Radio signals are just another frequency that needs a transmitter and receiver, which Tesla also demonstrated in 1893 during a presentation before The National Electric Light Association. 5. Limitless Free Energy - J.P. Morgan backed Tesla with $150,000 to build a tower that would use the natural frequencies of our universe to transmit data, including a wide range of information communicated through images, voice messages, and text. This represented the world&#39;s first wireless communications, but it also meant that aside from the cost of the tower itself, the universe was filled with free energy that could be utilized to form a world wide web connecting all people in all places, as well as allow people to harness the free energy around them.
