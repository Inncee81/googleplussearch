He has over 300 patents for many things we take for granted, including the following: 1. Alternating Current - A war was leveled between the vision of Edison and the vision of Tesla for how electricity would be produced and distributed. The division can be summarized as one of cost and safety: Tesla demonstrated that AC was perfectly safe by famously shooting current through his own body to produce light. Tesla&#39;s system that provides power generation and distribution to North America in our modern era. 2. Light --Of course he didn&#39;t invent light itself, but he did invent how light can be harnessed and distributed. Tesla developed and used florescent bulbs in his lab some 40 years before industry &quot;invented&quot; them. At the World&#39;s Fair, Tesla took glass tubes and bent them into famous scientists&#39; names, in effect creating the first neon signs. However, it is his Tesla Coil that might be the most impressive, and controversial. The Tesla Coil is certainly something that big industry would have liked to suppress: the concept that the Earth itself is a magnet that can generate electricity (electromagnetism) utilizing frequencies as a transmitter. 3. X-rays -- Electromagnetic and ionizing radiation was heavily researched in the late 1800s, but Tesla researched the entire gamut. Everything from a precursor to Kirlian photography, which has the ability to document life force, to what we now use in medical diagnostics, this was a transformative invention of which Tesla played a central role. 4. Radio -- Guglielmo Marconi was initially credited, and most believe him to be the inventor of radio to this day. However, the Supreme Court overturned Marconi&#39;s patent in 1943, when it was proven that Tesla invented the radio years previous to Marconi. Radio signals are just another frequency that needs a transmitter and receiver, which Tesla also demonstrated in 1893 during a presentation before The National Electric Light Association. 5. Limitless Free Energy - J.P. Morgan backed Tesla with $150,000 to build a tower that would use the natural frequencies of our universe to transmit data, including a wide range of information communicated through images, voice messages, and text. This represented the world&#39;s first wireless communications, but it also meant that aside from the cost of the tower itself, the universe was filled with free energy that could be utilized to form a world wide web connecting all people in all places, as well as allow people to harness the free energy around them.

Het resultaat is een verbruik van slechts 3,8 l/100 km, gekoppeld aan het prestatieniveau dat van een BMW verwacht mag worden.\u00a0 De BMW eDrive-aandrijflijn van de BMW Concept X5 eDrive omvat een viercilinder verbrandingsmotor met BMW TwinPower Turbo techniek en een eveneens door BMW ontwikkelde elektromotor met een vermogen van 70 kW (95 pk). De bestuurder heeft de keuze uit drie rijmodi: hybride, volledig elektrisch en de Safe Battery-modus. De hybridestand biedt een optimale balans in sportiviteit en efficiency. Met de boost-functie ondersteunt de elektromotor de verbrandingsmotor voor optimale prestaties. Hierdoor vergt de sprint vanuit stilstand naar 100 km/u minder dan 7 seconden. In de volledig elektrische modus kan de BMW Concept X5 eDrive maximaal dertig kilometer emissievrij afleggen. De topsnelheid in deze stand bedraagt 120 km/u. \u00a0In de Safe Battery-modus wordt de actuele accucapaciteit bewaard en kan worden \u2018gespaard\u2019 voor bijvoorbeeld een langere emissievrije rit door de stad. De BMW Concept X5 eDrive verbruikt slechts 3,8 l/100 km, wat overeenkomt met een CO2-uitstoot van minder dan 90 g/km. De elektromotor wordt gevoed door een lithium-ion-accu. Het opladen daarvan is mogelijk via elk huisstopcontact, een Wallbox en openbare laadpunten. De laadkabel is op te bergen in een daarvoor bedoelde ruimte onder de laadvloer. Daar weer onder bevindt zich de accu. Door de plaatsing van de accu onder de laadvloer is niet alleen nagenoeg alle bagageruimte behouden, het is ook de veiligste plaats voor de accu in het geval van een ongeval.\u00a0 Subtiele designelementen accentueren het effici\u00ebnte karakter van de BMW Concept X5 eDrive. Zo zijn de lamellen in de grille, de spijlen in de luchtinlaten en de inleg in de achterbumper uitgevoerd in de kleur BMW i Blue, dat speciaal voor de BMW i-modellen is ontwikkeld. De blauwe accenten vormen bovendien een fraai contrast met de metallic lak Silverflake waarin de carrosserie is uitgevoerd. De BMW Concept X5 eDrive is verder voorzien van speciale dakrails en een connector voor de oplaadkabel die blauw oplicht tijdens het laden. De aerodynamische vorm van de lichtmetalen 21-inch wielen oogt niet alleen fraai, maar draagt ook bij aan de reductie van de luchtweerstand.\u00a0 Dankzij nieuwe functionaliteiten van BMW ConnectedDrive weet de bestuurder altijd hoeveel kilometers hij nog elektrisch aangedreven kan afleggen. Het systeem houdt voor de berekening van de actieradius niet alleen rekening met de rijstijl, maar gebruikt ook parameters zoals de verkeersdrukte en de route. Ook laadpunten op de geplande route worden aangegeven. Met de Remote app beschikt de bestuurder via zijn smartphone over informatie met betrekking tot de status van de accu, de actieradius van de auto en beschikbare laadpunten langs de route.

Het tweede model in de nieuwe modelserie volgt dezelfde designtaal als de BMW 4 Serie Coup\u00e9. Met zijn elektrisch bedienbare hardtop, functionele eigenschappen en toonaangevende rijdynamiek voegt de BMW 4 Serie Cabrio een nieuwe dimensie toe aan de klasse van de middelgrote cabriolet. Dankzij zijn kenmerkende proporties en de toegenomen afmetingen oogt de open vierzitter n\u00f3g krachtiger dan zijn voorganger. Innovatieve BMW EfficientDynamics-technologie biedt efficiency en prestaties als nooit tevoren. De nieuwe BMW 4 Serie Cabrio maakt begin zomer 2014 zijn opwachting bij de Nederlandse BMW dealer. De nieuwe BMW 4 Serie Cabrio is de vijfde generatie van BMW\u2019s middelgrote premiumcabriolet. De auto biedt hoogstaand design en toonaangevende dynamiek, ongeacht of het dak is geopend of gesloten. Het interieur ademt dezelfde sportieve en luxueuze sfeer als dat van de BMW 4 Serie Coup\u00e9. De hoogwaardige materialen, het afwerkingsniveau en de ergonomie zijn best-in-class en ten opzichte van de BMW 3 Serie Cabrio is zowel de hoofd- als de beenruimte toegenomen. Met de M Sport-, Sport Line-, Modern Line- en Luxury Line-pakketten kunnen designkenmerken en materiaalkeuze naar wens worden bepaald. Krachtig silhouet Zijn opvallende aanwezigheid op de weg is mede te danken aan de toegenomen afmetingen. De BMW 4 Serie Cabrio is 26 mm langer (4.638 mm) dan de BMW 3 Serie Cabrio die hij vervangt. De wielbasis groeide met 50 mm en de spoorbreedte nam 43 mm toe. De cabrioletversie is 1.372 mm hoog en 1.825 mm breed. Typerende BMW-stijlelementen als de opmerkelijk korte overhangen accentueren het krachtige silhouet. Hardtop met Load Assist De driedelige, inklapbare hardtop van de BMW 4 Serie Cabrio is aanzienlijk verbeterd op het gebied van comfort en functionaliteit. De geluidsabsorberende hemelbekleding verlaagt het geluidsniveau in het interieur met circa 2 dB ten opzichte van de BMW 3 Serie Cabrio. De dynamische coup\u00e9 transformeert bovendien binnen 20 seconden en tot een snelheid van 18 km/h in een elegante cabriolet. De inhoud van de bagageruimte is riant in deze klasse. Met de kap gesloten is er 370 liter voorhanden. Zelfs als het dak in de bagageruimte is opgevouwen, zorgt de nieuwe Load Assist dat de 220 liter bergruimte optimaal kan worden benut. Het elektro-hydraulische systeem draait en herpositioneert het opgevouwen dak indien nodig, zodat er altijd goede toegang is en voldoende bagageruimte. Comfort Open rijden is in de BMW 4 Serie Cabrio comfortabeler dan ooit. Het verbeterde windscherm is kleiner, lichter en effectiever dan voorheen en kan eenvoudig worden opgeborgen. Tijdens open rijden houdt de climate control automatisch rekening met de buitentemperatuur om het voor de inzittenden zo behaaglijk mogelijk te maken. De stoelen met ge\u00efntegreerde veiligheidsgordels zijn bovendien voor het eerst leverbaar met \u2018Air Collar\u2019 nekverwarming. TwinPower Turbo De BMW 4 Serie Cabrio is in eerste instantie leverbaar met keuze uit drie motorvarianten. De BMW 435i Cabrio, BMW 428i Cabrio en de BMW 420d Cabrio zijn voorzien van de nieuwste BMW TwinPower Turbo-technologie. Het motorvermogen van deze range varieert van 135 kW (184 pk) tot 225 kW (306 pk). Alle motoren voldoen aan de Euro 6-emissienorm van 2014 en zijn standaard gekoppeld aan een handmatig te bedienen zesversnellingsbak. De beproefde achttrapsautomaat is in alle gevallen een optie. BMW EfficientDynamics Een uitgebreide reeks BMW EfficientDynamics-voorzieningen reduceren het brandstofverbruik en optimaliseren de prestaties. De Auto Start Stop-functie is standaard en de in het design verwerkte Air Curtains en Air Breathers zorgen voor minder luchtweerstand en optimale efficiency. De ondersteltechnologie van de BMW 4 Serie Cabrio is gebaseerd op die van de BMW 4 Serie Coup\u00e9. De BMW-ingenieurs hebben de veren en de dempers aangepast aan het karakter van de cabrioletversie. De BMW 4 Serie Cabrio biedt dan ook dezelfde, ongekende en toonaangevende rijdynamiek en hetzelfde stuurgevoel als de BMW 4 Serie Coup\u00e9. BMW ConnectedDrive\u00a0 De nieuwe BMW 4 Serie Cabrio is beschikbaar met een uitgebreide reeks rijhulpsystemen, mobiliteitsdiensten en infotainment onder de noemer BMW ConnectedDrive. De reeks omvat onder meer eCall (Emergency Call), de Active Cruise Control met Stop &amp; Go-functie en de Driving Assistant Plus, en het navigatiesysteem Professional.

Three petrol and three diesel variants are likely to be available on the 4 Series Convertible with the entry-level 420d, which uses a 184bhp 2.0-litre diesel engine engine and should return close to 60mpg, expected to account for over 50 per cent of sales. Sales on the 4 Series Convertible will begin in early 2014 and a slight premium over the coupe version is expected, which starts at \u00a329,200. #BMW #4series #4seriesconvertible #automotive #car #motoring #news #LAmotorshow", "sentiment_score": 0.04811946902654867, "postID": "z13jffyafmafwp4zm04cffhqxlazjxpiytk0k"}

As with the new 4 Series Coupe, the drop-top replaces the previous 3 Series-badged model. The new car is larger than the outgoing Convertible, but retains a three-piece folding steel hardtop, which takes 20 seconds to whir electronically into the boot. The top can be dropped while the car is driving, albeit at speeds of up to 11mph. Although similar in concept to the old car\u2019s roof, the top is a completely new design, with improved sound proofing and better aerodynamic efficiency helping to cut wind noise by two decibels with the roof up. Top down, BMW claims the optional redesigned air blocker is easier to use and more effective at reducing buffeting, while optional neck warmers for both front seats are available for the first time. BMW has worked to improve boot space. All models come with a new loading assistance feature that can move the folded roof up or down in the boot space to allow you to make the most of the 220 litres available with the roof stowed. With the roof up, there\u2019s a 370-litre boot \u2013 20 litres more than its predecessor. Three engines will be available at launch \u2013 two petrols and one diesel \u2013 borrowed from the 4 Series Coupe. The entry level model is the 420d powered by a 181bhp 2.0-litre diesel, while the petrols are the 428i with a 242bhp 2.0-litre, and a top-spec 435i which uses a 302bhp 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six. A six-speed manual will be standard, although most buyers are expected to opt for the eight-speed sports automatic with steering-wheel-mounted paddles. The auto offers better claimed fuel efficiency than the six-speed manual, regardless of engine choice. To ensure the 4 Series is sharp to drive, #BMW claims the new model is 40 per cent stiffer yet 20kg lighter than before. As with the Coupe, standard kit will be fairly generous, and includes xenon headlights (with full LED lights available as an option), heated electric front seats and front and rear parking sensors on all models.

The Mercedes-Benz S-Class has been viewed as the world&#39;s most successful luxury car for decades. That tradition is sure to be upheld with the latest version, the 2014 Mercedes Benz S-Class, available in a number of configurations. At a recent preview, international automotive journalists were afforded the opportunity to put the Euro-Spec S-Class models through their paces in a variety of real-world driving scenarios, as well as in closed-course exercises that demonstrated the new car&#39;s state-of-the-art technologies. The stable of S-Class vehicles for 2014 will consist of an S350 BlueTEC diesel V6, an S350 BlueTEC Hybrid, an S400 Hybrid and the S550. Models are configured in both a regular and a long-wheelbase offering. A 4MATIC all-wheel drive version will appear later, along with a plug-in hybrid example. An AMG version will become available in the near future. The 2014 Mercedes-Benz S550 will draw its motive force from a 4.6-liter, DOHC, 32-valve, twin-turbocharged, V8 engine with high-pressure fuel injection. The engine, which is mounted in front in a longitudinal orientation, delivers 455 hp at 5,250 rpm, while generating 258 lb ft of torque at 3,600 rpm. Driving energy is transferred to the rear wheels via a 7-G-Tronic Plus automatic transmission. In terms of its styling, the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S-Class continues to display instant recognizability, but with considerably bolder design cues. Up front, the radiator grille is now larger, more upright and distinctly three-dimensional, with three pronounced air intakes. The grille flows into the new LED headlamps and is followed by a long hood with accented side creases and a flowing domed roofline. The rear end slopes gently, showcasing classic saloon proportions, while projecting a coupe-like profile with blacked-out &quot;B&quot; pillars and athletically sweeping character lines. The ultimate goal of Mercedes-Benz is to create the best luxury vehicle in the world and to one day achieve a truly accident-proof car. In that quest, the new S-Class features more than 20 active safety systems - some completely new and others vastly enhanced or improved. The systems are based partially on a networked sensor system. The S-Class is able to detect bumps in the road through Road Surface Scan. When combined with the optional Magic Body Control suspension system for eight-cylinder models, it instantaneously sets up the suspension to smooth out the ride. Standard for S-Class is the continuously operating Active Damping System Plus, as well as an enhanced version of the AIRMATIC full air suspension system. My test 2014 Mercedes-Benz Euro-spec S500 came in a LWB configuration, featuring Magic Body Control. Pricing for that model hasn&#39;t been officially announced, but it is purported to reflect a range in keeping with current S-Class models, while taking into consideration the added technological systems. SUMMARY: The 2014 Mercedes-Benz S550 may well be the most advanced luxury saloon model available today. It gets high marks in virtually every category: acceleration, handling characteristics, safety technology, ride comfort and styling. I was able to drive on challenging rural roads and freeways, in addition to experiencing a simulator exercise that demonstrated many of the new and innovative features of the new S-Class. Mercedes-Benz is well on its way to delivering a near-perfect luxury sedan, one that could be virtually accident free. The new S-Class is a true example of German engineering superiority that delights practically every sense. There&#39;s a model to satisfy nearly everyone&#39;s desires and requirements.

That makes it \u00a35,000 cheaper than the #Audi A4 Allroad and \u00a32,400 less than the #VW Passat Alltrack. The Country Tourer is based on the Sports Tourer and benefits from all-wheel drive as standard, 20mm more ground clearance and tougher styling. Two trim levels will be available from launch, Country Tourer priced from \u00a325,349 to \u00a329,709 and Country Tourer Nav, costing from \u00a326,499 to \u00a330,859. Standard equipment across the range includes bi-exnon adaptive lighting, power tailgate and front and rear parking sensors. Country Tourer trim adds sat nav with 8-inch touchscreen, multi-function touch-pad controller and an additional 8-inch digital instrument cluster as standard. Two diesel engines are available, including a 2.0-litre BiTurbo CDTi developing 193bhp and 400Nm of torque and a 163bhp 2.0-litre CDTi engine. The more powerful BiTurbo diesel is only available as a six-speed automatic, while the more frugal CDTi engine can be fitted with a six-speed manual. To separate the Country Tourer from the standard car, it gets a wider and deeper front grille, as well as silver underbody protection at the front and rear. There&#39;s cladding on the side sills and around the wheel arches too, to finish off the tougher look. The electronically controlled four-wheel drive system can also vary torque between the front and rear axles which ensures maximum traction on surfaces whether on-road or off-road. To save fuel the system will also revert to front-wheel drive only when it senses that four-wheel drive is not necessary. Order books for the Country Tourer are now open, with first deliveries being made in January. #automotive \u00a0 #car \u00a0 #motoring \u00a0 #news", "replyCount": 0, "cleanContent": "Vauxhall Insignia Country Tourer pricing, spec and release date The #Vauxhall #Insignia #Country #Tourer is the latest addition to the range and is on sale now with prices starting from \u00a325,349.

Two diesel engines are available, including a 2.0-litre BiTurbo CDTi developing 193bhp and 400Nm of torque and a 163bhp 2.0-litre CDTi engine. The more powerful BiTurbo diesel is only available as a six-speed automatic, while the more frugal CDTi engine can be fitted with a six-speed manual. To separate the Country Tourer from the standard car, it gets a wider and deeper front grille, as well as silver underbody protection at the front and rear. There's cladding on the side sills and around the wheel arches too, to finish off the tougher look. The electronically controlled four-wheel drive system can also vary torque between the front and rear axles which ensures maximum traction on surfaces whether on-road or off-road. To save fuel the system will also revert to front-wheel drive only when it senses that four-wheel drive is not necessary. Order books for the Country Tourer are now open, with first deliveries being made in January. #automotive #car #motoring #news", "sentiment_score": 0.05231545741324921, "postID": "z130zh0wtpbpyb3fb22uvhrgdrvzhfrqg04"}

We already know how the new MINI will look, ahead of its debut at next month\u2019s LA Motor Show, thanks to the Vision concept MINI revealed in July. However, now we have the full tech specification on the third-generation hatchback. These include two 1.5-litre three-cylinder turbos \u2013 a 134bhp petrol with 220Nm of torque for the Cooper, and a 114bhp diesel with 270Nm for the Cooper D. A new petrol 2.0-litre with 189bhp and 280Nm will power the Cooper S, and be tuned to 220bhp for John Cooper Works models. All cars should be significantly faster than their predecessors, while MINI is promising big gains in efficiency through the extensive use of lightweight high-strength steels throughout. Two transmissions will be offered. A new six-speed manual gets the same rev-matching shift technology as the next BMW M3 and M4 for perfect downshifts. Meanwhile, the automatic option uses the same GPS-guided gear selection system as the Rolls-Royce Wraith \u2013 which prepares the transmission based on the type of corner or slope you\u2019re approaching. To boost ride comfort and everyday usability, adaptive dampers will be offered for the first time. Two settings \u2013 Sport and Comfort, accessed at the flick of a switch \u2013 will offer a sharper drive or a more relaxed ride. The multi-link rear suspension is retained, but has been heavily redesigned to ensure more rear space and a bigger boot. The load area will also be easier to access. A wider front and rear track plus stiffer suspension arms should also guarantee sporty handling, while the electric power-steering will have variable resistance for the first time to make the car easier to drive at low speeds and when parking. New Active Rotational Damping has been introduced to minimise torque steer, too \u2013 this should come in handy for the most powerful JCWs.

So, it is with this seething hatred fresh in my mind that I'm considering forming an exploratory committee to maybe think about writing another edition of Stock Android Isn't Perfect. If you need a refresher, go check out the first two, it's basically a list of things that annoy me. A lot has been fixed since then, and I intend to continue the style of Part 2, where check any previous grievance and show how it has been fixed. I always find the changes really interesting. Part 3 needs some new annoying stuff, and while I've been compiling a pretty good list, I figured I'd open the floor to reader submissions. If you have any stock Android 4.3 (and Gapp) annoyances in the style of the first two articles (consistency issues, things that don't make sense, stuff like that. Not \"Android should make me breakfast in the morning\") leave a comment explaining just what it is that sucks. If I agree with you, I might include it. Now is probably a good time to write something like this, since all the Googlers seem to be relaxing after the 4.3 launch (just look at all the G+ posts!). When the break's over maybe they'll look into fixing some stuff, since they'll be at the start of the dev cycle for the next version. Right guys? <3 If not, at least it will be fun for me to write and hopefully fun for you to read. So, things that annoy you in 4.3. Go!", "sentiment_score": 0.12223674242424241, "postID": "z120yvjgwnvidhelo23fhnqyxub4ttlhy04"}
