However, the launch was mostly interesting because of what happened after the payload was released. For the first time, the Falcon 9&#39;s main stage performed a controlled burn that safely brought it back into the atmosphere. &quot;It was a great day, and we accomplished all our objectives successfully,&quot; SpaceX founder Elon Musk said during a press call this afternoon. Communications had been established with all the satellites that were taken to orbit. The primary payload was Canada&#39;s CASSIOPE, which includes a set of environmental sensors linked to a test communication platform. The other three payloads included two university payloads and a small CubeSat. Normally, for a launch like this, the payloads are where the action is. But today&#39;s was substantially different, involving an upgraded version of the Falcon 9 booster. The new rocket features the Merlin 1D engine, which delivers more thrust and is easier to manufacture. The nine Merlin engines on the booster have also been rearranged, going from a grid-like formation to one where a circle of eight surrounds a central engine. The v1.1 is taller than its predecessor and features a larger fairing to hold its payload (the new one is five meters, roughly 16.5 feet, in diameter). Perhaps more significantly, v1.1 is set up so that SpaceX can have it back. The company has been using a testbed called Grasshopper to explore controlled landings of the rocket. Today&#39;s flight involved tests of a necessary counterpart: getting the boost stage from its launch trajectory back into the atmosphere in a controlled manner. After the second stage separated today, the boost stage reversed its orientation and fired some of its engines to slow its flight, allowing it to undergo reentry without a problem. Musk said that, upon reentry, boost phases &quot;normally explode due to extreme forces.&quot; Once it was back in the atmosphere, it lit its central engine to slow itself further. That&#39;s where things went wrong, though, as the booster started spinning. According to Musk, this &quot;centrifuged the propellant&quot;\u2014spun it to the tank&#39;s walls and kept it from feeding into the engine. As a result, it hit the water hard, leaving the company&#39;s employees with pieces to recover. (This rocket didn&#39;t have landing gear anyway, and Musk said that the added hardware would act like fins to stabilize the spin.) With the information they gained from this flight, however, Musk said that SpaceX has &quot;all the pieces to do full recovery of the boost phase,&quot; which he expects to be attempted early next year. In the intervening time, the company plans to gather data on re-entry during two more flights. Recovery won&#39;t be cheap. In response to a question, Musk estimated that saving the fuel to perform a controlled landing on water requires sacrificing 15 percent of the potential payload; returning to land will take a 30 percent cut. But Musk said the boost stage is about three-quarters of the total cost of the rocket, so being able to reuse it would provide a substantial net gain. Beyond these findings, not everything was rosy about today&#39;s launch. SpaceX also tried to restart its second stage engine (which is necessary on some flight trajectories but not for today&#39;s launch). The engine &quot;encountered a condition it didn&#39;t like during repressurization,&quot; though, and the process was shut down.

It&#39;s not part of our line up &amp; can&#39;t be activated^JH \u2014 VZW Support (@VZWSupport) September 17, 2013 Verizon is thus clearly violating FCC regulations governing its acquisition of the spectrum that enables its LTE service, which require it to open to all devices. To quote from the regulations (my emphasis): (b) Use of devices and applications. Licensees offering service on spectrum subject to this section shall not deny, limit, or restrict the ability of their customers to use the devices and applications of their choice on the licensee\u2019s C Block network, except: (1) Insofar as such use would not be compliant with published technical standards reasonably necessary for the management or protection of the licensee\u2019s network, or (2) As required to comply with statute or applicable government regulation. Verizon also violates its promise not to violate that requirement. On May 7, 2008, Ars Technica quotes Verizon VP Jim Gerace saying on the company\u2019s public policy blog: \u201cVerizon Wireless\u2014and all the other participants in the recent 700 MHz spectrum auction\u2014understood the FCC\u2019s rules for using that spectrum in advance of the auction. Of course we\u2019ll abide by those rules.\u201d I attempted to read the rest of Gerace\u2019s blog post but Verizon has erased years of its posts there and the Wayback Machine does not have a cache from that date. This promise came in response to a tough letter from Google at the time demanding that Verizon abide by the rule. Said Google: \u201cThe Commission must ensure that Verizon understands that this license obligation means what it says: Any Apps, Any Devices.\u201d And no wonder, for Google anticipated precisely this situation when it entered the spectrum auction Verizon won and insisted then on open access as an FCC condition of the sale: Google ended up marketing an unlocked device made to run on Verizon\u2019s LTE network and now Verizon refuses to honor its promise to abide by the rules of its auction to do so. On Twitter and Google+, many have asked why I bother, why I don\u2019t just install the T-Mobile SIM and month\u2019s free access that came with the Nexus 7 LTE. A few reasons: First, I am stuck with a shared-data plan on Verizon thanks to my locked (how could you, Google?!) Chromebook Pixel with LTE and my family\u2019s Verizon iPads. Second, adding the Nexus 7 to my shared-data plan will cost me only $10 more a month, less than I\u2019ll play if I support it solo on another carrier\u2019s network. Third, this is a matter of principle. I will bring my Dell Hell experience to bear and fight for what is right. Some also caution that on the Verizon network, my Nexus 7 will connect only if LTE is available; it will not be able to fail down to slower speeds as it could on other networks. True; that is how my Chromebook Pixel works and I am willing to live with the limitation for the price. It has also been pointed out to me across social media that one can take a Verizon SIM from another LTE device, put it in the Nexus 7, and it will work. Only problems are, I don\u2019t have such a SIM and if I did I\u2019d need to use it in that other device. But this does prove \u2014 as others have done it \u2014 that the Nexus 7 does work on Verizon\u2019s network. So this is not a matter of anything Verizon cannot do. This is a matter of what Verizon will not do. And that is what makes this a violation of FCC regulations and Verizon\u2019s assurances. I have frequently asked Verizon for its help on Twitter and Google+ and in its store and via phone to Verizon Wireless via a representative in that store; you see the net of that above: a smart-assed refusal to take my money. I tried many avenues before writing this post. I have twice asked Verizon Wireless\u2019 director of PR for devices, Albert Aydin (@VZWalbert) for a company statement on why it refuses to connect the Nexus 7 and I have heard nothing. I do so as a journalist and also as a member of the public (I take the title \u201cpublic relations\u201d literally). I will email this post to him once more asking for the company\u2019s statement. I will also ask Google PR for its stand regarding Verizon\u2019s violation of its assurances to the FCC and Google. Back in 2008, Verizon said: \u201cAs we work to put the spectrum we won to good use, if Google or anybody else has evidence that we aren\u2019t playing by the rules, there are legitimate and expedited ways to address that.\u201d Yes, like blogs, Twitter, Google+, Facebook, This Week in Google, and angry customers everywhere.
