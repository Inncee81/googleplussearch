Exterior changes include bespoke paint colours; Nimbus Grey for coupe models and Imola Yellow for roadsters. There's also a rear spoiler that's derived from that of the TT RS and five-spoke 19in alloy wheels. Inside, TTS Limited Edition models gain grey leather upholstery with \"baseball\" stitching and a \"1 of 500\" plaque in the door insert. Standard equipment includes sat-nav, Bose sound system, rear parking sensors and an upgraded interior light package. The TTS Limited Edition costs \u00a338,860 as a coupe and \u00a343,320 as a roadster. There's a premium of \u00a32,815 over standard TTS models, but Audi says the amount of extra equipment equates to a \"customer saving\" of about \u00a35,665 if the additional options were specified separately.Audi launched the TT in 1998 as a coupe and as a roadster the following year; the second-generation model arrived in 2006. An all-new TT is expected to go on sale in 2014. It will use the VW Group's MQB platform - which also underpins the latest VW Golf - and is expected to be lighter than the current car.

As with the new 4 Series Coupe, the drop-top replaces the previous 3 Series-badged model. The new car is larger than the outgoing Convertible, but retains a three-piece folding steel hardtop, which takes 20 seconds to whir electronically into the boot. The top can be dropped while the car is driving, albeit at speeds of up to 11mph. Although similar in concept to the old car\u2019s roof, the top is a completely new design, with improved sound proofing and better aerodynamic efficiency helping to cut wind noise by two decibels with the roof up. Top down, BMW claims the optional redesigned air blocker is easier to use and more effective at reducing buffeting, while optional neck warmers for both front seats are available for the first time. BMW has worked to improve boot space. All models come with a new loading assistance feature that can move the folded roof up or down in the boot space to allow you to make the most of the 220 litres available with the roof stowed. With the roof up, there\u2019s a 370-litre boot \u2013 20 litres more than its predecessor. Three engines will be available at launch \u2013 two petrols and one diesel \u2013 borrowed from the 4 Series Coupe. The entry level model is the 420d powered by a 181bhp 2.0-litre diesel, while the petrols are the 428i with a 242bhp 2.0-litre, and a top-spec 435i which uses a 302bhp 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six. A six-speed manual will be standard, although most buyers are expected to opt for the eight-speed sports automatic with steering-wheel-mounted paddles. The auto offers better claimed fuel efficiency than the six-speed manual, regardless of engine choice. To ensure the 4 Series is sharp to drive, #BMW claims the new model is 40 per cent stiffer yet 20kg lighter than before. As with the Coupe, standard kit will be fairly generous, and includes xenon headlights (with full LED lights available as an option), heated electric front seats and front and rear parking sensors on all models.

The images surfaced on a blog site and show the convertible alongside the 4 Series Coupe on which it\u2019s based.

We already know how the new MINI will look, ahead of its debut at next month\u2019s LA Motor Show, thanks to the Vision concept MINI revealed in July. However, now we have the full tech specification on the third-generation hatchback. These include two 1.5-litre three-cylinder turbos \u2013 a 134bhp petrol with 220Nm of torque for the Cooper, and a 114bhp diesel with 270Nm for the Cooper D. A new petrol 2.0-litre with 189bhp and 280Nm will power the Cooper S, and be tuned to 220bhp for John Cooper Works models. All cars should be significantly faster than their predecessors, while MINI is promising big gains in efficiency through the extensive use of lightweight high-strength steels throughout. Two transmissions will be offered. A new six-speed manual gets the same rev-matching shift technology as the next BMW M3 and M4 for perfect downshifts. Meanwhile, the automatic option uses the same GPS-guided gear selection system as the Rolls-Royce Wraith \u2013 which prepares the transmission based on the type of corner or slope you\u2019re approaching. To boost ride comfort and everyday usability, adaptive dampers will be offered for the first time. Two settings \u2013 Sport and Comfort, accessed at the flick of a switch \u2013 will offer a sharper drive or a more relaxed ride. The multi-link rear suspension is retained, but has been heavily redesigned to ensure more rear space and a bigger boot. The load area will also be easier to access. A wider front and rear track plus stiffer suspension arms should also guarantee sporty handling, while the electric power-steering will have variable resistance for the first time to make the car easier to drive at low speeds and when parking. New Active Rotational Damping has been introduced to minimise torque steer, too \u2013 this should come in handy for the most powerful JCWs. Finally, the new MINI will get clever passive safety technology, with a much stronger passenger cell, larger crumple zones front and rear plus a new bonnet that senses a collision and pops up to absorb more of the impact. Official performance and economy stats have yet to be revealed \u2013 but with the launch just under two months away, we\u2019ll have further details soon.", "replyCount": 0, "cleanContent": "Faster, greener MINI specs revealed Full tech specifications on the third-generation MINI have been revealed - including every detail of the new three and four-cylinder engine families.

The Mercedes-Benz S-Class has been viewed as the world&#39;s most successful luxury car for decades. That tradition is sure to be upheld with the latest version, the 2014 Mercedes Benz S-Class, available in a number of configurations. At a recent preview, international automotive journalists were afforded the opportunity to put the Euro-Spec S-Class models through their paces in a variety of real-world driving scenarios, as well as in closed-course exercises that demonstrated the new car&#39;s state-of-the-art technologies. The stable of S-Class vehicles for 2014 will consist of an S350 BlueTEC diesel V6, an S350 BlueTEC Hybrid, an S400 Hybrid and the S550. Models are configured in both a regular and a long-wheelbase offering. A 4MATIC all-wheel drive version will appear later, along with a plug-in hybrid example. An AMG version will become available in the near future. The 2014 Mercedes-Benz S550 will draw its motive force from a 4.6-liter, DOHC, 32-valve, twin-turbocharged, V8 engine with high-pressure fuel injection. The engine, which is mounted in front in a longitudinal orientation, delivers 455 hp at 5,250 rpm, while generating 258 lb ft of torque at 3,600 rpm. Driving energy is transferred to the rear wheels via a 7-G-Tronic Plus automatic transmission. In terms of its styling, the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S-Class continues to display instant recognizability, but with considerably bolder design cues. Up front, the radiator grille is now larger, more upright and distinctly three-dimensional, with three pronounced air intakes. The grille flows into the new LED headlamps and is followed by a long hood with accented side creases and a flowing domed roofline. The rear end slopes gently, showcasing classic saloon proportions, while projecting a coupe-like profile with blacked-out &quot;B&quot; pillars and athletically sweeping character lines. The ultimate goal of Mercedes-Benz is to create the best luxury vehicle in the world and to one day achieve a truly accident-proof car. In that quest, the new S-Class features more than 20 active safety systems - some completely new and others vastly enhanced or improved. The systems are based partially on a networked sensor system. The S-Class is able to detect bumps in the road through Road Surface Scan. When combined with the optional Magic Body Control suspension system for eight-cylinder models, it instantaneously sets up the suspension to smooth out the ride. Standard for S-Class is the continuously operating Active Damping System Plus, as well as an enhanced version of the AIRMATIC full air suspension system. My test 2014 Mercedes-Benz Euro-spec S500 came in a LWB configuration, featuring Magic Body Control. Pricing for that model hasn&#39;t been officially announced, but it is purported to reflect a range in keeping with current S-Class models, while taking into consideration the added technological systems. SUMMARY: The 2014 Mercedes-Benz S550 may well be the most advanced luxury saloon model available today. It gets high marks in virtually every category: acceleration, handling characteristics, safety technology, ride comfort and styling. I was able to drive on challenging rural roads and freeways, in addition to experiencing a simulator exercise that demonstrated many of the new and innovative features of the new S-Class. Mercedes-Benz is well on its way to delivering a near-perfect luxury sedan, one that could be virtually accident free. The new S-Class is a true example of German engineering superiority that delights practically every sense. There&#39;s a model to satisfy nearly everyone&#39;s desires and requirements.

The Country Tourer is based on the Sports Tourer and benefits from all-wheel drive as standard, 20mm more ground clearance and tougher styling. Two trim levels will be available from launch, Country Tourer priced from \u00a325,349 to \u00a329,709 and Country Tourer Nav, costing from \u00a326,499 to \u00a330,859. Standard equipment across the range includes bi-exnon adaptive lighting, power tailgate and front and rear parking sensors. Country Tourer trim adds sat nav with 8-inch touchscreen, multi-function touch-pad controller and an additional 8-inch digital instrument cluster as standard. Two diesel engines are available, including a 2.0-litre BiTurbo CDTi developing 193bhp and 400Nm of torque and a 163bhp 2.0-litre CDTi engine. The more powerful BiTurbo diesel is only available as a six-speed automatic, while the more frugal CDTi engine can be fitted with a six-speed manual. To separate the Country Tourer from the standard car, it gets a wider and deeper front grille, as well as silver underbody protection at the front and rear. There&#39;s cladding on the side sills and around the wheel arches too, to finish off the tougher look. The electronically controlled four-wheel drive system can also vary torque between the front and rear axles which ensures maximum traction on surfaces whether on-road or off-road. To save fuel the system will also revert to front-wheel drive only when it senses that four-wheel drive is not necessary.

With its arrival in Alice Springs, the Audi A3 Sportback 1.4 TFSI COD has now covered half the 3000 km distance to Adelaide, but temperatures are expected to rise on day three and there will be more traffic, with the solar cars \u2013 and their fleets of support vehicles \u2013 expected to be within an hour of the Audi. In addition, the availability of the 130 km/h speed limit in the Territory will be swapped for the strictly enforced 110 km/h limit in South Australia, soon after leaving Alice Springs. #Audi #A3 #WSC13", "sentiment_score": 0.016456521739130436, "postID": "z13dvplhooqzhrksa22bcvygosqwydxxl04"}
