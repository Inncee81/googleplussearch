It&#39;s a mixture of nostalgia, and great setting and characters, and writing. Not sure how I feel about the overarching theme(s) but each story is done well with different styles. It feels nostalgic because the korean actress Doona Bae is in it. Long long time ago I watched a small korean movie called &quot;Take Care of My Cat&quot; back when I was a depressed university student. It was my favourite movie back then and I must have seen it over a dozen times. She starred in it, and already by then she was really famous in korea. Anyway I haven&#39;t seen anything of hers since and coincidentally she was in this movie, so it made me feel nostalgic for a terrible time. She&#39;s still as beautiful now as she was in this movie, as she was in that movie a long time ago. She&#39;s kind of a one dimensional actor though. English coach did a nice job. I really liked all the story lines. The writing in the gay composers sub plot is incredible. Dear diary, I am a wordsmith. Doona Bae&#39;s sub plot is 90s cyber punk. Haha hell yeah, the makeup/prosthetics just accentuates it. The old man publisher jailbreak is hilarious. Also, Tom Hanks is impressive. The fact that all the plots are tied together in multiple ways gives it an epic feel and I mean that literally. Through generations, recurring characters run through the same themes tied together by simple motifs, and it makes me feel good. The extreme makeup actually helps with that feel because with the ensemble cast in different settings and stories, it feels like watching a multi-act play. Initially I thought the asian prosthetics stuff looked fucking ridiculous but when viewed through this light and the 90s cyberpunk style it became fine. And I know it was on purpose since they could have easily cgi&#39;d it up or used even crazier techniques to make it less noticeable, but they wanted the audience to recognize the similarities amongst the different backdrops. Anyway, though maybe the messages are of the timeless variety, without even what I consider modern twists, I really like the movie. Or what am I saying? This movie is the definition of timeless with a modern twist, but so is every good new movie, and for some reason it certainly didn&#39;t feel that way to me.

I mean I&#39;m not gonna rag on the writer or director or anyone else for creating the movie, there&#39;s no way they could have not made this movie given their experiences and influences. But imo the movie sucked donkey nuts. The problem with it for me is if at the outset the movie isn&#39;t out there or unrealistic then I expect hard sci-fi. The story has the guy on the international space station. Then why do I see earth-like gravity? Why is he just standing around? Budget constraints I&#39;m sure but it&#39;s honestly terrible. This is compounded by the fact we see him running on the treadmill multiple times. Seeing that fucker on the treadmill just reminds me that they didn&#39;t have enough budget to have things float around, which is terrible. Later they stop giving a care about the treadmill and there are no adverse physical effects. So it&#39;s just a time wasting prop. The part where a prerecorded message is sent up saying &quot;you&#39;re stuck on the station, hold up for awhile&quot; with no reason or explanation is also unbelievable. Could have at the very minimum given a reason like &quot;Nuclear attack&quot; or something, but of course it&#39;s all mysterious to attempt to create a suspenseful atmosphere which is just thrown away once they show the lights winking out. If I was NASA I&#39;d send a message explaining the situation because I&#39;m not an asshole and it doesn&#39;t take even a second more of effort The next part is he becomes a bit crazy cause he&#39;s isolated. That was laughable. I&#39;ve once spent an entire month and a half not talking to another human being except to order food once in awhile although I&#39;m not sure ordering fast food counts as communication. And that was after a good year of isolating myself from everyone I knew. I went a bit crazy sure, but as portrayed I can only say the acting/screenwriting was weak. They could have made him go goofy bonkers and it would have been more realistic. I also didn&#39;t understand why he&#39;d get mad an throw things around cause things didn&#39;t work. Doesn&#39;t he have astronaut training. Then again I guess NASA budget cuts really hurt them. I also don&#39;t see why the station would go into complete disrepair in like a month or 6. And what&#39;s with the flashing neon lights inside the docking part of the ISS. Why does the guy never look down at the earth at night? Finally we get to the &quot;abstract&quot; part of the movie. The problem here is it&#39;s not abstract enough. It reminded me of some documentary that had people share their experiences with drugs, except instead they&#39;re sharing their experiences with life. Pretty deep if you ask me, but you didn&#39;t.

I mean I'm not gonna rag on the writer or director or anyone else for creating the movie, there's no way they could have not made this movie given their experiences and influences. But imo the movie sucked donkey nuts. The problem with it for me is if at the outset the movie isn't out there or unrealistic then I expect hard sci-fi. The story has the guy on the international space station. Then why do I see earth-like gravity? Why is he just standing around? Budget constraints I'm sure but it's honestly terrible. This is compounded by the fact we see him running on the treadmill multiple times. Seeing that fucker on the treadmill just reminds me that they didn't have enough budget to have things float around, which is terrible. Later they stop giving a care about the treadmill and there are no adverse physical effects. So it's just a time wasting prop. The part where a prerecorded message is sent up saying \"you're stuck on the station, hold up for awhile\" with no reason or explanation is also unbelievable. Could have at the very minimum given a reason like \"Nuclear attack\" or something, but of course it's all mysterious to attempt to create a suspenseful atmosphere which is just thrown away once they show the lights winking out. If I was NASA I'd send a message explaining the situation because I'm not an asshole and it doesn't take even a second more of effort The next part is he becomes a bit crazy cause he's isolated. That was laughable. I've once spent an entire month and a half not talking to another human being except to order food once in awhile although I'm not sure ordering fast food counts as communication. And that was after a good year of isolating myself from everyone I knew. I went a bit crazy sure, but as portrayed I can only say the acting/screenwriting was weak. They could have made him go goofy bonkers and it would have been more realistic. I also didn't understand why he'd get mad an throw things around cause things didn't work. Doesn't he have astronaut training. Then again I guess NASA budget cuts really hurt them. I also don't see why the station would go into complete disrepair in like a month or 6. And what's with the flashing neon lights inside the docking part of the ISS. Why does the guy never look down at the earth at night? Finally we get to the \"abstract\" part of the movie. The problem here is it's not abstract enough. It reminded me of some documentary that had people share their experiences with drugs, except instead they're sharing their experiences with life. Pretty deep if you ask me, but you didn't. You instead asked yourself and you answered, \"this part of the movie sucks.\" The american civil war thing also touched me, although I didn't enjoy it the last time my uncle touched me there.

All of this post is just frustration trying to get an intuitive grasp of why the compiler hates certain method signatures in a covariant class. I looked around for a good while before deciding to check the part in Programming in Scala about covariances and seeing the reason there. I was trying to find a counterexample detailing why the compiler hates: class Whatever[+T](t: T) { \u00a0 def whatever(t: T): Whocares } The reason is because it is then possible to do something like this due to the covariance of Whatever: val w: Whatever[Any] = new Whatever(123) // line1 w.whatever(&quot;hello&quot;) Because of the covariance of Whatever, Whatever[Any] is a supertype of Whatever[Int] (which is what the type of new Whatever(123) is). So line1 is legal. Because w is of type Whatever[Any], the object w has the method whatever(t: Any). Because String is a subtype of Any we have w.whatever(&quot;hello&quot;) being possible. However the runtime type of w is Whatever[Int] so it&#39;s obviously not going to work. Therefore either Whatever is invariant or we have to change the method signature of whatever. The common way of changing it is this: def whatever[B &gt;: T](b: B): Whocares What this says is the parameter given to whatever must be a supertype of T. Because all types in Scala are connected in one single tree (the root being Any), there is literally no parameter that will not be accepted by whatever. A concrete example would be: val w = new Whatever(123) // type is Whatever[Int] w.whatever(&quot;Hello&quot;) // w.whatever[B &gt;: Int](&quot;Hello&quot;: B) String extends AnyVal (or AnyRef? Well I read somewhere that the literal converts to a java.lang.String then gets implicitly converted to another type when calling Scala methods on it which I suppose makes it an AnyRef in either case). Int extends AnyVal. Both AnyVal and AnyRef extend Any. So the only B that is a &quot;Hello&quot; and a supertype of Int is Any. Check out this signature: def whatever(f: (T) =&gt; Int): Whocares I think this will compile fine even if Whatever is covariant. The reason is even if you have val w: Whatever[Any] = new Whatever(124) w.whatever((x: Ballz) =&gt; 222) // line2 there will be a compile error at line2. The reason is because as explained in my previous post Ballz =&gt; Int is NOT a subtype of Any =&gt; Int The reasoning (as my previous post pointed out) is that Ballz can be considered a subset of Any (in the context of a function) therefore there may be elements in Any that are not in Ballz which breaks the Balls of our Ballz =&gt; Int function. In other words: Let a in Any s.t. a not in Ballz val f = (x: Any) =&gt; 3 val g = (x: Ballz) =&gt; 4 val result: Int = f(a) Suppose that Ballz =&gt; Int subtype of Any =&gt; Int then g should be substitutable for f without breaking anything: val result: Int = g(a) but g is not defined for a since a not in Ballz Here is one more example to make sure my ballz are thoroughly broken. def whatever(a: List[T]): Whocares // doesn&#39;t work with covariance val w: Whatever[Any] = new Whatever(123) w.whatever(List(&quot;String&quot;)) // cant be done since List[String] is not a List[Int] I think I understand covariance and contravariance although it doesn&#39;t come naturally at all.

In other words: Let a in Any s.t. a not in Ballz val f = (x: Any) => 3 val g = (x: Ballz) => 4 val result: Int = f(a) Suppose that Ballz => Int subtype of Any => Int then g should be substitutable for f without breaking anything: val result: Int = g(a) but g is not defined for a since a not in Ballz Here is one more example to make sure my ballz are thoroughly broken. def whatever(a: List[T]): Whocares // doesn't work with covariance val w: Whatever[Any] = new Whatever(123) w.whatever(List(\"String\")) // cant be done since List[String] is not a List[Int] I think I understand covariance and contravariance although it doesn't come naturally at all. Definitely one of those category theory things that being a computer science graduate it seems like I should know but magically took never that course.

So, firstly, if you saw my posts after the writing conference last month, you know the development executive I&#39;ve been building a relationship with for several years expressed interest in working with me. I sent him an idea and he&#39;s enthusiastically supportive, so I&#39;m basically working on spec now to build a world that will support a film franchise plus storytelling in other media.

Thirdly, after struggling to eke out writing time from my new family life, I bit the proverbial bullet and started getting up earlier on work mornings in order to write for an hour. This still only gives me about five hours per week, but that&#39;s a whole lot better than where I&#39;ve been.

Much of this shift is because of technologies and sites that allow crowd sourcing like indiegogo.com . In fact that is where I was introduced the current indie project (UK Based) \"The Expedition\" I am involved with slated to release in 2014 during what I believe to be a year of monsters and indie. On a scholarly note - in the July 2013 Oxford Journals - Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society: An Abstract (used with permission) noted the the shift and why \"highly leveraged distribution conglomerates have shifted risks to creative content producers.\" (source: Hollywood in decline? US film and television producers beyond the era of fiscal crisis - By: Susan Christopherson Department of City and Regional Planning, Cornell University, 106 Sibley Dome, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA, smc23{at} cornell.edu ) Personally speaking in just the last couple of weeks since I began conversation with public about our film through various media \"The Expedition\" has gone up in popularity by 56% as well as being listed in IMDBs Most Voted \"Monster\" Feature Film Released in 2014 moving from the 11th spot to the 6th, while Hollywood's rebaked \"Godzilla\" went from #1 to #8.

After services, as I was walking to my car with my family, I checked my cell phone messages. The message left was from Steve Jobs. &quot;Vic, can you call me at home? I have something urgent to discuss&quot; it said. Before I even reached my car, I called Steve Jobs back. I was responsible for all mobile applications at Google, and in that role, had regular dealings with Steve. It was one of the perks of the job. &quot;Hey Steve - this is Vic&quot;, I said. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t answer your call earlier. I was in religious services, and the caller ID said unknown, so I didn&#39;t pick up&quot;. Steve laughed. He said, &quot;Vic, unless the Caller ID said &#39;GOD&#39;, you should never pick up during services&quot;. I laughed nervously. After all, while it was customary for Steve to call during the week upset about something, it was unusual for him to call me on Sunday and ask me to call his home. I wondered what was so important? &quot;So Vic, we have an urgent issue, one that I need addressed right away. I&#39;ve already assigned someone from my team to help you, and I hope you can fix this tomorrow&quot; said Steve. &quot;I&#39;ve been looking at the Google logo on the iPhone and I&#39;m not happy with the icon.

Since I was 11 years old and fell in love with an Apple II, I have dozens of stories to tell about Apple products. They have been a part of my life for decades. Even when I worked for 15 years for Bill Gates at Microsoft, I had a huge admiration for Steve and what Apple had produced. But in the end, when I think about leadership, passion and attention to detail, I think back to the call I received from Steve Jobs on a Sunday morning in January.
