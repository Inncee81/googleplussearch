Because it is small at this point, I am sure you will find the members eager to participate with you in all manner of related subjects! I am very glad to see that you will be asking questions. The reason for this is that it gives other members of the group to try and help, and therefore provides more helpful content to the group. That is hugely helpful, so I hope that we see you here often. Please do not hesitate. I am sure that since you have been doing this work for your business in a highly competitive area, you have more than plenty to contribute yourself! Since we are making introductions, I will introduce myself. I am Daniel. I am a semi-retired web developer just doing projects that I find interesting in some manner. My main background is in advertising, web design and development with a strong preference for content management systems (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Concrete and such). I also have done allot of print material as large as billboards to as small as business cards and everything in between. Since, as you know, SEO has many elements to it, I focus mainly on &quot;on-site SEO&quot;. That is to say making sure that elements on a site are compliant to SEO standards and also making sure that the work also converts potential clients. As you have probably learned by now, having a large load of traffic does not necessarily guarantee success.
