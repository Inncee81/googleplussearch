When attempting to prank your friends, stealth is key. You also have to really want to make them feel as much pain and humiliation as possible. Luckily, the existence of smartphones can help a lot. Besides the old-fashioned and, lets be honest, predictable method of simply hacking a friend&#39;s Facebook or Twitter, the iPhone&#39;s features make it particularly well-suited for pranks. Because we&#39;re firm believers in a good prank, we&#39;ve come up with six great ways to prank your friend&#39;s iPhone. Have any more phone pranks for making your loved ones miserable? Tell us about them in the comments. 1. The &quot;Stuck in the iPhone&quot; Prank A quick and easy, the ol&#39; &quot;stuck in the phone&quot; lock screen bit is a modern classic, and requires little effort on your part. Using your ninja skills, simply hack into your friend&#39;s iPhone, and take a picture of yourself behind a pane of glass. Then go into Settings and make that picture your friend&#39;s lock screen. The next time he opens his phone, he&#39;ll be impressed by your sneakiness. 2. The &quot;Autocorrect Everything&quot; Prank If you&#39;re looking to infuriate your friends and potentially cause them some really awkward text conversations with their contacts, you should consider the autocorrect dictionary prank. In the general settings of a friend&#39;s iPhone, click on Keyboard and scroll to the bottom where it says Add New Shortcut. There, you can create a new autocorrect word or phrase that the iPhone will attempt to enter whenever your friend types a common word. Don&#39;t worry, some day they&#39;ll look back at this and laugh. 3. The &quot;Contact Switcheroo&quot; Prank No-brainer here. After what we&#39;ll call &quot;friendly stealing&quot; your pal&#39;s phone, switch up his contacts&#39; names and numbers. Change his significant other&#39;s phone number to his mom&#39;s phone number. Direct his best friend&#39;s number (assuming that&#39;s no longer you) to that of a local pizzeria. You get the drill. 4. The &quot;Broken Touch Screen&quot; Prank This prank will require a solid distraction, as your friend will need to be away from his device for up to 10 minutes. Take a screenshot of your friend&#39;s homescreen, and make that screenshot his wallpaper. Then drag all of his home screen apps into a folder on the second screen, leaving the homescreen as if it were frozen and un-clickable. 5. The &quot;iPhoneception&quot; Prank The iPhoneception site allows you to get a little sophisticated with your pranks. Open the site with your friend&#39;s mobile browser and select one of the available animations. Create a homepage bookmark and open the animation. When your friend unlocks his phone, he&#39;ll watch his apps blow up, crumble off the screen or turn into kittens. Then he&#39;ll probably stop being your friend.", "replyCount": 0, "postID": "z13efz3zstylcjlqa04cjzg4zzn3tvvjefk"}
