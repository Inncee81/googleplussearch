A camera with build in flash, a polystyrene cup, a piece of paper, a film canister and a business card is all it takes to make a fully functional photo studio
Sonys official Slideshow, reveals an upcoming A-Mount camera as a silhouette. How should it be interpreted? Are they trying to show it as being between the A77 and A99, or will it replace both?
A camera with build in flash, a polystyrene cup, a piece of paper, a film canister and a business card is all it takes to make a fully functional photo studio
Jaak didnt you have some special way you set up A99 to take "silent" photos?
The wakeup call for Nikon and Canon. Sony just made a dent in your strategies.
Definately not news, but strangely, sonys new A7 is not the first Alpha 7. In 2001 minolta launched the first Alpha7- but then again, sony bought minolta, so why not
Very thorough and thoughtfull review of the two new Alpha cameras. Lots of info and you can follow his findings as he finds things out.
Oh i love My Nik Software, but after watching this video, where i found out, that i can actually make a non destructive photo editing workflow, i love it even more wow, thats neat.
What to choose, what to choose, hmmmm
Comprehensive review; Is the Sony Alpha 3000 an ideal alternative to entry level DSLR?
My favorite photographer, Trey Radcliff, made the change to Sony mirrorless a while ago, and he intends to upgrade to the new A7r. Here´s his opinion on the new beast from Sony...
Sony released a video example from the Sony A7r
Get a full size image examples from the Sony A7r right here..
Field test of the Sony A7r....
Hold on to your hats. Sony brings out all the bells and whistles on this one. Looks like a major film production
B&H takes you through the advantages and features of the brand new full-frame A7 and A7r cameras -and introduces the Rx10 plus new lenses and adaptors.
The new fullframe A7 and A7r have dual menu systems, so you can choose between the NEX or Alpha look and functionality. According to DPreview- the "NEX"brand now disappears and get the designation "Alpha"- so now its all one big happy family. Sadly they dont have "in house image stabilization" but the new lenses come with OSS (stabilisation in the lens) Visit SGNL to watch Kenta show of the new cameras.
"This is the future for cameras" - as one reader at DPreview put it. Head over and see why the first review brought him to that conclusion.
Take on a hike in the woods with the brand new Alpha7 and Alpha7r
Sony just shook the camera World with not one, but two! Palm sized full-frame, interchangeable lens, mirrorless cameras! Meet 24 and 36 million pixels of goodness.
John Sison posted another of his fine reviews- this time its the A58 he takes through the paces.
LowRes images of the upcoming fullframe NEX cameras are beginning to show on the net. Not very pretty camera houses to my taste, but they might turn up being ok in real life.
Absolutely amazing "Do It Yourself" stabilized camera gimbal. Simply brilliant stuff!... Links for more info:
Watch this and see whats possible to do with a NEX camera - when you want to make movies. I was genuinly impressed. Tons of tips and links to free tutorials!..
When Sony bought Minolta, they also got a truly innovative flash system on their hands. Setting up and understanding flash tech suddenly became much easier. Heres how.
Autumn moods Sony A99 and Sigma 12-24mm Lightroom and Nik ColorEfex4 and SilverEfex2
Quote from a high-placed person in the photo industry "Nikon and Canon will become like Lionel trains – for collectors".
Mr. Kilpatrick really delivers on reviews - very thorough and real-life informative.
Gary Fong shows you how to sync up to 1/8000 sec!!!!
Though it doesn't seem the most active of blogs- it is a blog for professional Sony Photography.
Stumbled upon this Sony Imaging website. Lots of interesting stuff for Sony Shooters.
Download free and very handy "lighting setup" cheat sheet from Digital Camera World.
Four famous photographers and a Sony challenge.
I have always wanted to know how to take your camera under water. Go to 6:58 for DSLT option Underwater Housings for Video
Michael Yamashita enjoys to work the A99
Beautiful video of Paris- made with the awesome A99
Remember sony buying into Olympus? This teaming should result in Olympus making lenses for Sony A-mount, and Sony gaining access to, say, Olympus 5 axis sensor stabilization - AND perhaps this?
One of my good friends took this excellent picture with her Nikon camera- but the point i want to show was not about Nikon, but how much post editing can do. She took it through Lightroom (left) and i took it through lightroom, then NIK colorefex 4, then back through Lightroom once more.... Im getting to the point where i think good shoots are 50% the shot itself, and 50% is editing and adjusting. What do you think?

Four famous photographers and a Sony challenge.
I have always wanted to know how to take your camera under water. Go to 6:58 for DSLT option Underwater Housings for Video
Michael Yamashita enjoys to work the A99
Beautiful video of Paris- made with the awesome A99
Remember sony buying into Olympus? This teaming should result in Olympus making lenses for Sony A-mount, and Sony gaining access to, say, Olympus 5 axis sensor stabilization - AND perhaps this?
One of my good friends took this excellent picture with her Nikon camera- but the point i want to show was not about Nikon, but how much post editing can do. She took it through Lightroom (left) and i took it through lightroom, then NIK colorefex 4, then back through Lightroom once more.... Im getting to the point where i think good shoots are 50% the shot itself, and 50% is editing and adjusting. What do you think?
Take on a hike in the woods with the brand new Alpha7 and Alpha7r
Sonys official Slideshow, reveals an upcoming A-Mount camera as a silhouette. How should it be interpreted? Are they trying to show it as being between the A77 and A99, or will it replace both?
A camera with build in flash, a polystyrene cup, a piece of paper, a film canister and a business card is all it takes to make a fully functional photo studio
Jaak didnt you have some special way you set up A99 to take "silent" photos?
The wakeup call for Nikon and Canon. Sony just made a dent in your strategies.
Definately not news, but strangely, sonys new A7 is not the first Alpha 7. In 2001 minolta launched the first Alpha7- but then again, sony bought minolta, so why not
Very thorough and thoughtfull review of the two new Alpha cameras. Lots of info and you can follow his findings as he finds things out.
Oh i love My Nik Software, but after watching this video, where i found out, that i can actually make a non destructive photo editing workflow, i love it even more wow, thats neat.
What to choose, what to choose, hmmmm
Comprehensive review; Is the Sony Alpha 3000 an ideal alternative to entry level DSLR?
My favorite photographer, Trey Radcliff, made the change to Sony mirrorless a while ago, and he intends to upgrade to the new A7r. Here´s his opinion on the new beast from Sony...
Sony released a video example from the Sony A7r
Get a full size image examples from the Sony A7r right here..
Field test of the Sony A7r....
Hold on to your hats. Sony brings out all the bells and whistles on this one. Looks like a major film production
B&H takes you through the advantages and features of the brand new full-frame A7 and A7r cameras -and introduces the Rx10 plus new lenses and adaptors.
The new fullframe A7 and A7r have dual menu systems, so you can choose between the NEX or Alpha look and functionality. According to DPreview- the "NEX"brand now disappears and get the designation "Alpha"- so now its all one big happy family. Sadly they dont have "in house image stabilization" but the new lenses come with OSS (stabilisation in the lens) Visit SGNL to watch Kenta show of the new cameras.
"This is the future for cameras" - as one reader at DPreview put it. Head over and see why the first review brought him to that conclusion.
Take on a hike in the woods with the brand new Alpha7 and Alpha7r
Sony just shook the camera World with not one, but two! Palm sized full-frame, interchangeable lens, mirrorless cameras! Meet 24 and 36 million pixels of goodness.
John Sison posted another of his fine reviews- this time its the A58 he takes through the paces.
LowRes images of the upcoming fullframe NEX cameras are beginning to show on the net. Not very pretty camera houses to my taste, but they might turn up being ok in real life.
Absolutely amazing "Do It Yourself" stabilized camera gimbal. Simply brilliant stuff!... Links for more info:
Watch this and see whats possible to do with a NEX camera - when you want to make movies. I was genuinly impressed. Tons of tips and links to free tutorials!..
When Sony bought Minolta, they also got a truly innovative flash system on their hands. Setting up and understanding flash tech suddenly became much easier. Heres how.
Autumn moods Sony A99 and Sigma 12-24mm Lightroom and Nik ColorEfex4 and SilverEfex2
Quote from a high-placed person in the photo industry "Nikon and Canon will become like Lionel trains – for collectors".
Mr. Kilpatrick really delivers on reviews - very thorough and real-life informative.
Gary Fong shows you how to sync up to 1/8000 sec!!!!
Though it doesn't seem the most active of blogs- it is a blog for professional Sony Photography.

One of my good friends took this excellent picture with her Nikon camera- but the point i want to show was not about Nikon, but how much post editing can do. She took it through Lightroom (left) and i took it through lightroom, then NIK colorefex 4, then back through Lightroom once more.... Im getting to the point where i think good shoots are 50% the shot itself, and 50% is editing and adjusting. What do you think?
