My own (completely baseless) speculation: - "Google Experience" will be some sort of meta-package on Play that downloads and installs the GEL, calendar, clock, dialer, keyboard etc. etc. Either that, or all those Google apps will be rebranded as "Google Experience <X>" for easy discovery. - The transparent notification and soft-buttons will be available to other apps, but they'll need to update the manifest to specifically support it. Otherwise, it'll just be the same as 4.3.
