Thanks for sharing Gordon, I really appreciate the help!
An iconic picture, I'm sure I could resist the urge to replicate it either. Nice shot Gordon!

Thank you + George Krieger ! As long as you indicated you weren't really familiar with Leicas in the first three questions, your input is indeed useful to me. Thanks! Thank you + Ian Wilkinson ! As an M9-P owner I can tell it is an absolute delight to be able to use a red dot camera, and I certainly hope you will be able to get one some day as well!
The survey is now closed, since I have gathered enough data! Thanks again for participating everyone!
