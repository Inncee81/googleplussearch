Like nearly everything in photography - it depends! For video, the answer is obviously a resounding NO! The GH3 is hard to top. However, for stills, I 'd have to say - probably yes. Some say the GH3 is really not all that great for stills as it is, and that the EM-5 already had it beat there. I can't opine since I don't have an EM-5, but I'd be curious as to what others that might hve both cameras have to say on that front.
