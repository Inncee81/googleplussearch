Hi Chris, we order in most of our stock which we get in next day - we can drop it over to you if you're local? Do you have a camera in mind?
For around that budget I would recommend the Mio MiVue 338 or 358 - the video quality is better on those which is important. If you can stretch, the BlackVue 380 is one of the best cheaper cams out there.
