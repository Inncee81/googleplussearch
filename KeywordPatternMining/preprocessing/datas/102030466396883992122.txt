I imagine it is unique to the SmartWatch 2. As that looks more like it's interface with the Sony made widget. Whether Sony allows 3rd party developers access to the SmartWatch 2 OS to take advantage of this remains to be seen. However, since the watch isn't out yet. Even if they are, I am sure they are telling the developers they can't release it to the store till the watch officially launches later this month.
Ahh this explains all the SmartWatch and Sony Xperia Z1 reviews hands-on reviews I have been seeing! Thanks for the info. I'm in U.S. So it's not here yet!
