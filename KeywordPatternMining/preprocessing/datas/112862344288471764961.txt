Versatile! I think this is the first portrait work I've seen of yours. Nice!
Busy times? Coffee on the way brother...
Looking forward to your review! This just might be out of my price range for the moment. The looming Macbook Pro refresh put me in a holding pattern. I also have come to the conclusion, like many other ventures, that the equipment doesn't make the photographer. I'm enjoying my little Sony RX100 II but find myself lacking in the basics. Yourself, + Trey Ratcliff and many more the like of make it look so easy. That being said--I may still pick up a Nex 6 or 5T to afford me with more lens choices. I remember that + Doug Kaye said he may sell his Nex 6 when this announcement hit.

Great read! Not being critical but there's a typo: "Now sone of my own Key Points from me after VERY little use with it:"
