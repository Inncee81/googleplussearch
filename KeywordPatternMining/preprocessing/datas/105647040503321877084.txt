Can someone send me a copy of that social contract? I can't find my copy. The truth is that a successful company that is shipping more product is buying more trucks and burning more gas and is thusly paying more for roads. If they are expanding their building they are paying more local property taxes and thusly educating more kids, employing more fireman and police officers. The owners and stock holders are paying more taxes as their incomes and capital gains increase. Elizabeth Warren is being dishonest to suggest successful businesses and their don't continue to increase the amount of taxes they remit to the government. They do.
