Welcome to the club, guess there are 100's if not 1000's asking me themselves the Same question. Hopefully we know more next week as going back to PC means going back all the associated headaches like viruses and other cha'chas. If PC I would always opt for a high end Dell or HP. But Frank, maybe you have some advise on the latest Adobe saga not supporting the IQ2 series digital backs? Getting used to C1P is a pain but adobe seems to pull this play as a strategic move against the "new" competition....
Other option is to buy the "old" Mac Pro, prices might well go south and it's an amazing machine. One option I currently consider....waiting for the new one to be released.
