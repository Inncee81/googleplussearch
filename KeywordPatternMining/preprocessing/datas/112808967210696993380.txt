In sporting events the English National Anthem is "God Save The Queen" the Scots have "Flower of Scotland", Wales "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" and Northern Ireland "Londonderry Air". The British National Anthem is not played for the 4 nations which make up the UK in sporting events.
Ps. I quite happily sing God Save The Queen at sporting events and I'm a Scot.
