I've been testing the new Aviate Android launcher. It's a very special launcher that changes your home screens based on where you are, what time of the day it is, or what you use the most. Unfortunately I don't like it at all. Here is a video I did with it and my thoughts. #aviate #android #launcher
+ Jamaar DeBoise It's not for me either. I don't like it at all
+ Tim Renshaw Yes same with me, Android is a great OS where we can customize our homescreens to our likings, Aviate removes much of that. I don't like that.
+ Urban Persson Yes that would have been better, but even then, I wouldn't have used it.
+ Derrick Best I have uninstalled it so I can't send out invites anymore
+ Derrick Best I am very happy with Sony Stock. The best launcher I have ever used.
+ Derrick Best That was a very long time ago Sony makes a very light skinned UI now, so it is almost stock android. The small changes they make now is only to the better. And the new Xperia Z1 is the best phone on the market at the moment.
+ Derrick Best Yeah but the Nexus 5 will not have the same high end specs as the Xperia Z1 though, it has to keep the price low. I prefer a high end specced phone like the Z1.
+ Derrick Best I have the Z1 as you can see in the video, and I have owned and tried a lot of phones, the Z1 is the best I have tried. I will buy the Z2 next year
+ Rolf Brandser I liked the alphabetical slider too
Way cool, I've got Sony's totally free playmemories service now. It uploads all your photos in full resolution for free, as many you like, so you can store them there and get to them from any device. That means that I don't have to bother with saving the photos on my computer anymore! Thanks Sony.
+ Danni Efraim You can get to your photos from a computer or any device though.
+ Martin Cronier Great. The strange thing is that when I go the the web version of the site it says 5GB free only... but on the phone it says unlimited.. So I don't get it?
+ Martin Cronier Credit card? I didn't have to do that.. I just enable it on my Xperia Z1.
+ Tony Sågare + Martin Cronier Ok, I haven't seen that yet. What does the campaign do then?
Nexus 5 Press Photos Leaked Google and LG is going to release another Nexus phone, the Nexus 5 really soon (Oct 28), for a rumored price of $349-$399 USD for the 16GB and 32GB versions. Now some press images for the TELUS version of the Nexus 5 has leaked . In these images we can see ...
+ Jamaar DeBoise I can understand that
+ Andreas Trygg It usually is released a bit later here in Sweden, but not so late ;)
+ Daniel Dumitrascu Yeah definitely better than the HTC One. The Xperia Z1 is a beautiful piece of technology too though ;)
+ Daniel Dumitrascu Yeah I did the Nexus 5 too, but will not buy it ;)
+ Daniel Dumitrascu no not for me either and the Z1 have better specs
+ Corbin Doak it's leaked press photos, they are almost always renders, but they are official so it will look like this
+ Tissot Regis yeah then your have all of them, a whole store with phones ;-)
+ Carlos Estornell-Borrull I already bought a beauty, the Xperia Z1 ;-)
+ Tissot Regis I would do the same, if i had the money ;-)
This is BS, Google+ drives most of my referral traffic to my blog at www.svartling.net . I don't even get near that from Facebook or Twitter.
+ Ishan Jain Yes I'll agree and I see more and more users following me everyday. Google+ is growing incredibly fast. I can feel it.
+ Paul Simbeck-Hampson Totally agree. It's the new Google
+ LeGrand Johnson Exactly, and those who don't like Google+ hasn't used it enough and most importantly, haven't engaged with the users. So many "big websites" and writers just doing a link dump here and never come back to interact. That is the worst way doing it.
+ Mads Gorm Larsen Yes I am questioning the numbers:
+ Pysanky Pittsburgh that is what all these writers says too, of course there is inactive accounts, but there is a lot of them on Facebook and Twitter too
Not many uses shareholic to share to Google+
Seriously why would we want to have such a strange thing like this? See the video.
+ Fredrik Marklund You mean smartwatch era is coming to an end and not smartphone?
+ Ishan Jain No I haven't watched that video
A new SwiftKey 4.3 beta is available with multiple keyboard layouts and custom positions. I still thinks that Swype is the fastest keyboard though: #swiftkey #swype #android #keyboard
+ Johan Carleson Yes SwiftKey is good but personally I have proven for my self that Swype is faster. And yes these kind of keyboards is a reason to switch from iOS
I thought so too until I tried Swype again and found out it was better for swiping
Here is what I think:
Download the new Google Music update here. With the "I'm feeling lucky" radio button and all.
+ Rolf Brandser Well I got a Google Music account a long time ago, and it works great for uploading music, but I can't buy music there.
+ Rolf Brandser Yeah I moved to France for a while I like how it works.
+ Ron Carlson why not use the app?
+ David Allen No probably not, but my MacBook Air will get a lot better battery life. A lot of new cool features for that. For example the new multitasking feature taken from iOS.
+ Danni Efraim Ok, well I am always on the move with my MBA. Only docked a few hours every evening
+ Fritz Alcindor Yeah that's what I think too. But I think it's more like the Microsoft Surface cover/keyboard
+ Paul Murley yes that is very cool
+ Fabrizio Paterlini probably not but I will use my hundreds of bought ios apps on my MacBook device. And buy new ones of course. My MacBook air has replaced my iPad and will continue to do so even better then
+ Fabrizio Paterlini it will be awesome to be able to run ios apps on the MBA.
This is awesome! Maybe this update fixes the audio recording bug on the Sony Xperia Z1. I hope so. I haven't got the update yet. Thanks for the news tip + Jonas Björk
+ Tony Sågare I think your phone was already used. That's why this happens. No startup guide choose of language and so on. No dock.. I would replace it if I were you
Here is the changes:
+ Robert Sørensen I think it already is, as you know
+ Andrew Farmer See all my posts about it from this weekend. It's absolutely amazing. No mobile camera beats it
+ Andrew Farmer and see my blog post here:
+ Robert Sørensen No but I have showing you the facts, real photos that beats everything I've seen. That is enough to prove that I am right. So no need to discuss. I have the proof.
+ Andrew Farmer You're welcome As you can see in the google+ post with all the photos, all thinks the photos is amazing, so I am not alone ;)
+ Robert Sørensen everyone agrees with me except you on this post: https://plus.google.com/u/0/104961406012654314344/posts/TXbTvcqaCbL That says enough for me
+ Robert Sørensen the iPhone that you embrace so high can't simply take photos with such awesome depth of field as you can see in my rose or leaf photo. That's the same technique Sony uses in their Nex and rx cameras
+ Robert Sørensen yeah and you trust reviewers more than yourself. Why not take some photos and see for yourself?
+ Andrew Farmer thanks for letting me know
I use the Z1 camera in 8 megapixel mode instead of the highest. It seems that it is more optimized for that, and it is also the default mode
+ Robert Sørensen but why? When you own it? Why not test it yourself instead of going for what you read? I have at least done that. And as you can see for yourself, it takes awesome photos if you look at the ones I've made. So take some photos and start appreciate the awesome camera in your phone instead
+ Tony Sågare great, too bad you had some problems though. It will probably be better with the new phone though
This is what I think of the HTC One Max HTC has presented their phablet called One Max . It has a 5.9-inch 1080p display, and is designed like the HTC One. Except for the fingerprint scanner on the back. Why a fingerprint scanner? Unfortunately I can’t see any use for the One Max’s fingerprint sc...
+ Tim Simon Totally agree. New technologies needs a lot of testing before implementing.
+ Rolf Brandser more powerful processor usually means that it uses more power but I can be wrong

Will Apple release a 12-inch Retina MacBook with a complete new design that is thinner than the Air? - I hope so, it would be awesome!

+ Ellis Z The latest MacBook Air is awesome, so just buy that. I highly recommend it.
This is my review of the Mugen Power extended battery for the Samsung Galaxy S3 I’ve been testing an 4600mAh extended battery from Mugen Power , for my Samsung Galaxy S3 , with the battery comes a “Battery Door” as Mugen Power calls it, it’s a new backplate that the phone needs with this much thicker battery. And I must say that this b...
+ Fahad Suleman Thanks. It gets very thick but feels nice anyways. Lighter than the Z1 even with this battery
+ Fahad Suleman Heh! yeah that could be good to have ;)
Ok, so all the rumors were true about the HTC One Max , the 5.9-inch phablet. The fingerprint scanner seems to be quite gimmicky don't you think? And why doesn't the camera has no OIS? See my posts about it here: #htc #htconemax
+ Stefan Bergman Yeah but they have removed OIS
+ Stefan Bergman Optical Image Stabilization for the camera.
+ Stefan Bergman Ok, buy it and write a review for me ;) It would be very cool to know what you think of it:
+ Robert Sørensen The Z1 has software based image stabilization only.
+ Stefan Bergman I think it will be released quite soon in Sweden though. Just after the UK release.
+ Stefan Bergman I think that is when it will launch in the UK.
LG G Flex - another curved phone Some leaked photos of the LG G Flex has showed up. It’s LG’s answer to Samsung’s Galaxy Round, a 6-inch phone with a rounded (flexible) display. And to be honest, it feels once again like the android device manufacturers doesn’t have a clue on what they sho...
+ Krister Persson I don't either

I did a photo walk today with the awesome camera on the Sony Xperia Z1. Check out the photos I took in the album below. https://plus.google.com/photos/104961406012654314344/albums/5934186269081188737 #sony #xperiaz1 #photo #photos #photowalk
+ Fahad Suleman Yeah I think so too
+ Jean-Louis Laenens Yes I love the camera on the Xperia Z1
+ Ramon Nuez Excellent camera on the phone
+ Vikas Shah Yeah you have the same awesome camera ;)
+ Vikas Shah OK, yeah the weather has been bad here too, but this weekend was nice
This is why I love the camera on the Sony Xperia Z1 ;) + Robert Sørensen and + Andreas Lanjerud
+ Luther Cale you're welcome
+ Kashif Zahid Thank you. I am very happy with the camera on this phone! The best I've ever had.
+ Robert Sørensen I am sure that the iPhone5S can't take pictures like this. Especially not as the close up pictures or in the shadows or low light conditions. Totally sure.
+ Robert Sørensen Well the camera sensor in the Z1 is 9mm thick, there is no way the iPhone 5S can take as good photos. It is physically impossible. And I will have an iPhone 5S in November/December.
+ Robert Sørensen I think it's the details like you can see in the rose photo that the iPhone 5S can't do because it doesn't have the same sized sensor. The DSLR-like effect is amazing
+ Robert Sørensen The focusing on the object and blurring out the surroundings.
Here is what I think of the leaked Google Nexus 5 video A quite long video with the Nexus 5 has leaked out, it shows an early prototype in all it’s glory. I think the hardware looks quite cool, and the camera looks to be very good with a large sensor. I also like the speakers at the bottom of the phone. Another ...
+ Fahad Suleman Yeah To me 16GB is enough in my Xperia Z1 though. For storage I use a 32Gb microSD card
+ Sam McKeown I never use cases either, and I really like how Sony made the camera on the Xperia Z1, but as I said in the post, this is a very early prototype
+ Jamaar DeBoise I've had LTE for a while now and I can't be without it, it's a huge difference for the experience. I hope the language processing will support more languages.
+ Samuel Boynton I don't know how many times I've said this, no other custom roms is available for the GT-i9305 version of the S3. The few there is except for CM is very buggy
+ Stefan Bergman OK, I haven't had any crashes. These crashes you usually get when going from Cyanogenmod 10.1 to 10.2
+ Stefan Bergman you can't do that. You need to do a clean install between those two versions﻿. You can't use the updater
+ Frank Küsel Yeah but the phone I have is a GT-i9305.
+ Frank Küsel SO I think that is the latest kernel
+ Frank Küsel Ok, but I know that not all kernels works with the GT-i9305
+ Stefan Bergman You're welcome. You always need to do a clean install when going between larger Android updates. This time from Android 4.2.2 to Android 4.3 (CM 10.1 and CM 10.2). The same will be when Android 4.4 is released and CM will be based on that.
I bought this DayDream app for my Sony Xperia Z1. Seems to work quite good together with Sony's Smart Connect feature when putting the phone in the dock.

I think you know how much I love Google+ by now , and one thing I really like is that our Google+ posts shows up in Google Search when you have the personal/private search results activated. It is very good for users like me that uses Google+ as a blog. The more users that has that feature activated, the more users see our Google+ posts. #google #google+ #googleplus #search
+ Marvin Süß Ok, I use google.com . Strange that you don't have that button though, because it's available on google.se I think

+ vinay moharil the Z1f will never come to the US, and I am happy with the size of the Z1

Updated this blog post with my vlog about why Swype is the best android keyboard.
+ Vince DeGeorge Yes I was a huge iPhone fanboy before, and now I can't see how I could ever use an iPhone again. I can't be without these keyboards.
+ Vince DeGeorge iOS is too closed. Apple needs to let the user choose default apps for stuff like this
After being a SwiftKey user for 10 months, testing TouchPal X for a couple of weeks, and then found Swype again, after being using it as my first keyboard a year ago, I am now back on Swype . It is simply the best Android keyboard. You can have a very high error level but Swype still knows what word you want. No questions about it. You can't just say that Swiftkey is better after using Swype for only a day or two. Because Swype doesn't work like that. It has to learn your mistakes and the words you use, so you have to use it for at least two weeks before you can decide which keyboard is the best. #swype #swiftkey #touchpalx #android #keyboard
+ Douglas Pierre As I said in the video, Swype beats Swiftkey but you have to use it for 14 days or more before you can feel it
+ Urban Persson Very, very good, and the best is that you can have a very high error level when swiping and Swype knows what words you want anyways. I like that a lot, because that means that I can swipe very fast.
Nuance is simply the most professional company when it comes to this. It's obvious when you use their Swype product
+ Johan Cyréus it's very easy, just Swype from Swype button to space bar to do that
Well after testing different keyboards for a year, I've come to the solution that Swype is the keyboard that is most professional and is the fastest way to type for me. No matter if I use both Swedish and English
+ Urban Persson I don't see that as a problem because it's so easy to switch by swiping from the Swype button to spacebar
Ok, but you see on the keys what you get.
+ Urban Persson I think you will learn which key to press the more you using it. And the more you swipe, the faster it will be because it learns what words you use.
Sony rolling out their own todo list, tasks app for the Sony Xperia Z1. Available in update center on your phone
+ Tony Sågare I haven't used it much yet. Released an hour ago But no it's not as good because it's only available on your phone
Notifications works and you can check them off with checkmarks
+ Tony Sågare That's great! You won't be disappointed I have a white too by the way
I've been using this web browser on iOS, it's quite good, now available on Android
After been using the Mugen Power Extended battery for my Samsung Galaxy S3 for some days now, I must say that the thickness comes with an incredible good battery life . This battery is perfect when you need to have power for a little longer period of time than usually. The included back cover also has a built-in kickstand that makes it comfortable to watch movies, or using it as an alarm clock on your desk. Even if it's as thick as it is, the Galaxy S3 still feels very comfortable in your hand. The phone is still actually lighter with this battery, than my new Sony Xperia Z1 is. I can highly recommend this extended battery. Check it out here: And a user guide here: Visit there site here: #mugenpower #mugen #battery + Mugen Power Batteries Italy #samsung #galaxys3
How did Apple recreate the Gold Rush? Here is one more post written by + Micah Howe for Svartling Network . This time it is a bit provocative about the Gold iPhone 5S. I'll agree though that Apple needs to do more than this. It's the same phone as the iPhone 5, but with a fingerprint scanner and new color. #apple #iphone #iphone5s
+ Viktor Sarge As long as you are happy with it and thinks it useful, then there is no need to switch
+ Viktor Sarge I love my Macs but I think they work quite well with my android phones too
+ Andreas Lanjerud Not much use for the 64-bit yet though. It drains battery life quite much though.
+ Andreas Lanjerud The Xperia Z1 camera is awesome, and I am sure that it beats the iPhone 5S camera. It has a much larger camera sensor
+ Andreas Lanjerud and you don't have an iphone 5s yet
+ Andreas Lanjerud I want to see some photos from the iPhone 5s before I say it has a better camera than the Z1, because I don't believe that at all
+ Andreas Lanjerud Yeah and I can't see that the iPhone is better. Not by far
+ Andreas Lanjerud why should I believe them more than myself?
+ Robert Sørensen I haven't needed using the Flash yet. I rather don't use flash they always destroys the photo
Here is another camera comparison: Where the Z1 is better. Especially in low light conditions.
+ Robert Sørensen I see a lot of positive reviews. SO I don't agree on this
+ Robert Sørensen I trust my own experience. The camera is absolutely fantastic, that's my own opinion after using it. It takes some DSLR quality photos.
A rumor says that the Sony Xperia Z1 will get an Android 4.4 update in November - that would be awesome!

+ Ellis Z no never, because my Mac can run the same thing through the chrome web browser, with app launcher and all. Best of both worlds. And my MacBook has better build quality and better performance
+ Ellis Z no the cloud can never replace the speed of an ssd drive for example and the technology like video and music it's always one step before cloud, so when cloud finally can work with 1080p video, we already have 4k video format as an example
Motorola DVX will also have Motorola’s X8 computers system with a separate core for natural speech recognition, and that is what I don’t get? How will Motorola do with the natural speech recognition with a global release , will it support all different languages then? I don’t think so, because that is something that not even Google with Google Now or Apple with Siri has solved yet… #motorola #dvx #motoroladvx
HTC on it's death bed HTC will eventually not survive as an independent company anymore. According to Asymco’s Horace Dediu it’s very rare that manufacturers survive when they start posting losses of their device sales, they usually get bought by larger companies then. That was ...
Yes they make great devices but no one buys them sadly
+ Ellis Z yes that's right, they should have jumped over to android earlier
+ Fahad Suleman that's true but they held on to Windows too long at the same time
+ Dan Forslund That would never happen though
+ Joe Sears Agreed, that's why I like what Sony is doing
+ Richard Querrey that's right, no surprise at all really. Yes it could be a badly run company but it could bee to late to fix that now
+ Steve Okamoto interesting, I wonder what quality issues though
+ Scott Wilson ok, but he has a point that most manufacturer get bought up when they are in the state HTC is in now though

+ LeGrand Johnson Exactly, and those who don't like Google+ hasn't used it enough and most importantly, haven't engaged with the users. So many "big websites" and writers just doing a link dump here and never come back to interact. That is the worst way doing it.
+ Mads Gorm Larsen Yes I am questioning the numbers:
+ Pysanky Pittsburgh that is what all these writers says too, of course there is inactive accounts, but there is a lot of them on Facebook and Twitter too
Not many uses shareholic to share to Google+
Seriously why would we want to have such a strange thing like this? See the video.
+ Fredrik Marklund You mean smartwatch era is coming to an end and not smartphone?
+ Ishan Jain No I haven't watched that video
A new SwiftKey 4.3 beta is available with multiple keyboard layouts and custom positions. I still thinks that Swype is the fastest keyboard though: #swiftkey #swype #android #keyboard
+ Johan Carleson Yes SwiftKey is good but personally I have proven for my self that Swype is faster. And yes these kind of keyboards is a reason to switch from iOS
I thought so too until I tried Swype again and found out it was better for swiping
Here is what I think:
Download the new Google Music update here. With the "I'm feeling lucky" radio button and all.
+ Rolf Brandser Well I got a Google Music account a long time ago, and it works great for uploading music, but I can't buy music there.
+ Rolf Brandser Yeah I moved to France for a while I like how it works.
+ Ron Carlson why not use the app?
+ David Allen No probably not, but my MacBook Air will get a lot better battery life. A lot of new cool features for that. For example the new multitasking feature taken from iOS.
+ Danni Efraim Ok, well I am always on the move with my MBA. Only docked a few hours every evening
+ Fritz Alcindor Yeah that's what I think too. But I think it's more like the Microsoft Surface cover/keyboard
+ Paul Murley yes that is very cool
+ Fabrizio Paterlini probably not but I will use my hundreds of bought ios apps on my MacBook device. And buy new ones of course. My MacBook air has replaced my iPad and will continue to do so even better then
+ Fabrizio Paterlini it will be awesome to be able to run ios apps on the MBA.
This is awesome! Maybe this update fixes the audio recording bug on the Sony Xperia Z1. I hope so. I haven't got the update yet. Thanks for the news tip + Jonas Björk
+ Tony Sågare I think your phone was already used. That's why this happens. No startup guide choose of language and so on. No dock.. I would replace it if I were you
Here is the changes:
+ Robert Sørensen I think it already is, as you know
+ Andrew Farmer See all my posts about it from this weekend. It's absolutely amazing. No mobile camera beats it
+ Andrew Farmer and see my blog post here:
+ Robert Sørensen No but I have showing you the facts, real photos that beats everything I've seen. That is enough to prove that I am right. So no need to discuss. I have the proof.
+ Andrew Farmer You're welcome As you can see in the google+ post with all the photos, all thinks the photos is amazing, so I am not alone ;)
+ Robert Sørensen everyone agrees with me except you on this post: https://plus.google.com/u/0/104961406012654314344/posts/TXbTvcqaCbL That says enough for me
+ Robert Sørensen the iPhone that you embrace so high can't simply take photos with such awesome depth of field as you can see in my rose or leaf photo. That's the same technique Sony uses in their Nex and rx cameras
+ Robert Sørensen yeah and you trust reviewers more than yourself. Why not take some photos and see for yourself?
+ Andrew Farmer thanks for letting me know
I use the Z1 camera in 8 megapixel mode instead of the highest. It seems that it is more optimized for that, and it is also the default mode
+ Robert Sørensen but why? When you own it? Why not test it yourself instead of going for what you read? I have at least done that. And as you can see for yourself, it takes awesome photos if you look at the ones I've made. So take some photos and start appreciate the awesome camera in your phone instead
+ Tony Sågare great, too bad you had some problems though. It will probably be better with the new phone though
This is what I think of the HTC One Max HTC has presented their phablet called One Max . It has a 5.9-inch 1080p display, and is designed like the HTC One. Except for the fingerprint scanner on the back. Why a fingerprint scanner? Unfortunately I can’t see any use for the One Max’s fingerprint sc...
+ Tim Simon Totally agree. New technologies needs a lot of testing before implementing.
+ Rolf Brandser more powerful processor usually means that it uses more power but I can be wrong
+ Rolf Brandser ok, that sounds good
Will Apple release a 12-inch Retina MacBook with a complete new design that is thinner than the Air? - I hope so, it would be awesome! Anlyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, is usually quite reliable when it comes to “predictions” about Apple products. Now he sees a 12-inch MacBook with a new thinner and lighter design than the Air, including a Retina display. And to me that sounds very, v...

+ Ellis Z The latest MacBook Air is awesome, so just buy that. I highly recommend it.
This is my review of the Mugen Power extended battery for the Samsung Galaxy S3 I’ve been testing an 4600mAh extended battery from Mugen Power , for my Samsung Galaxy S3 , with the battery comes a “Battery Door” as Mugen Power calls it, it’s a new backplate that the phone needs with this much thicker battery. And I must say that this b...
+ Fahad Suleman Thanks. It gets very thick but feels nice anyways. Lighter than the Z1 even with this battery
+ Fahad Suleman Heh! yeah that could be good to have ;)
Ok, so all the rumors were true about the HTC One Max , the 5.9-inch phablet. The fingerprint scanner seems to be quite gimmicky don't you think? And why doesn't the camera has no OIS? See my posts about it here: #htc #htconemax
+ Stefan Bergman Yeah but they have removed OIS
+ Stefan Bergman Optical Image Stabilization for the camera.
+ Stefan Bergman Ok, buy it and write a review for me ;) It would be very cool to know what you think of it:
+ Robert Sørensen The Z1 has software based image stabilization only.
+ Stefan Bergman I think it will be released quite soon in Sweden though. Just after the UK release.
+ Stefan Bergman I think that is when it will launch in the UK.
LG G Flex - another curved phone Some leaked photos of the LG G Flex has showed up. It’s LG’s answer to Samsung’s Galaxy Round, a 6-inch phone with a rounded (flexible) display. And to be honest, it feels once again like the android device manufacturers doesn’t have a clue on what they sho...
+ Krister Persson I don't either
+ Jamaar DeBoise Or a smartwatch that goes around your wrist

What I think of the Camera on the Sony Xperia Z1 I really like the camera on my new Sony Xperia Z1 . It takes excellent still photos. But unfortunately not as good videos.

I did a photo walk today with the awesome camera on the Sony Xperia Z1. Check out the photos I took in the album below. https://plus.google.com/photos/104961406012654314344/albums/5934186269081188737 #sony #xperiaz1 #photo #photos #photowalk
+ Fahad Suleman Yeah I think so too
+ Jean-Louis Laenens Yes I love the camera on the Xperia Z1
+ Ramon Nuez Excellent camera on the phone
+ Vikas Shah Yeah you have the same awesome camera ;)
+ Vikas Shah OK, yeah the weather has been bad here too, but this weekend was nice
This is why I love the camera on the Sony Xperia Z1 ;) + Robert Sørensen and + Andreas Lanjerud
+ Luther Cale you're welcome
+ Kashif Zahid Thank you. I am very happy with the camera on this phone! The best I've ever had.
+ Robert Sørensen I am sure that the iPhone5S can't take pictures like this. Especially not as the close up pictures or in the shadows or low light conditions. Totally sure.
+ Robert Sørensen Well the camera sensor in the Z1 is 9mm thick, there is no way the iPhone 5S can take as good photos. It is physically impossible. And I will have an iPhone 5S in November/December.
+ Robert Sørensen I think it's the details like you can see in the rose photo that the iPhone 5S can't do because it doesn't have the same sized sensor. The DSLR-like effect is amazing
+ Robert Sørensen The focusing on the object and blurring out the surroundings.
Here is what I think of the leaked Google Nexus 5 video A quite long video with the Nexus 5 has leaked out, it shows an early prototype in all it’s glory. I think the hardware looks quite cool, and the camera looks to be very good with a large sensor. I also like the speakers at the bottom of the phone. Another ...
+ Fahad Suleman Yeah To me 16GB is enough in my Xperia Z1 though. For storage I use a 32Gb microSD card
+ Sam McKeown I never use cases either, and I really like how Sony made the camera on the Xperia Z1, but as I said in the post, this is a very early prototype
+ Jamaar DeBoise I've had LTE for a while now and I can't be without it, it's a huge difference for the experience. I hope the language processing will support more languages.
+ Samuel Boynton I don't know how many times I've said this, no other custom roms is available for the GT-i9305 version of the S3. The few there is except for CM is very buggy
+ Stefan Bergman OK, I haven't had any crashes. These crashes you usually get when going from Cyanogenmod 10.1 to 10.2
+ Stefan Bergman you can't do that. You need to do a clean install between those two versions﻿. You can't use the updater
+ Frank Küsel Yeah but the phone I have is a GT-i9305.
+ Frank Küsel SO I think that is the latest kernel
+ Frank Küsel Ok, but I know that not all kernels works with the GT-i9305
+ Stefan Bergman You're welcome. You always need to do a clean install when going between larger Android updates. This time from Android 4.2.2 to Android 4.3 (CM 10.1 and CM 10.2). The same will be when Android 4.4 is released and CM will be based on that.
I bought this DayDream app for my Sony Xperia Z1. Seems to work quite good together with Sony's Smart Connect feature when putting the phone in the dock.

I think you know how much I love Google+ by now , and one thing I really like is that our Google+ posts shows up in Google Search when you have the personal/private search results activated. It is very good for users like me that uses Google+ as a blog. The more users that has that feature activated, the more users see our Google+ posts. #google #google+ #googleplus #search
+ Marvin Süß Ok, I use google.com . Strange that you don't have that button though, because it's available on google.se I think
+ Marvin Süß That's strange, because it has worked for me since day one
+ Marvin Süß Well I thought most users had that. Apparently not.

+ vinay moharil the Z1f will never come to the US, and I am happy with the size of the Z1

+ Andreas Lanjerud yes I've read that
Updated this blog post with my vlog about why Swype is the best android keyboard.
+ Vince DeGeorge Yes I was a huge iPhone fanboy before, and now I can't see how I could ever use an iPhone again. I can't be without these keyboards.
+ Vince DeGeorge iOS is too closed. Apple needs to let the user choose default apps for stuff like this
After being a SwiftKey user for 10 months, testing TouchPal X for a couple of weeks, and then found Swype again, after being using it as my first keyboard a year ago, I am now back on Swype . It is simply the best Android keyboard. You can have a very high error level but Swype still knows what word you want. No questions about it. You can't just say that Swiftkey is better after using Swype for only a day or two. Because Swype doesn't work like that. It has to learn your mistakes and the words you use, so you have to use it for at least two weeks before you can decide which keyboard is the best. #swype #swiftkey #touchpalx #android #keyboard
+ Douglas Pierre As I said in the video, Swype beats Swiftkey but you have to use it for 14 days or more before you can feel it
+ Urban Persson Very, very good, and the best is that you can have a very high error level when swiping and Swype knows what words you want anyways. I like that a lot, because that means that I can swipe very fast.
Nuance is simply the most professional company when it comes to this. It's obvious when you use their Swype product
+ Johan Cyréus it's very easy, just Swype from Swype button to space bar to do that
Well after testing different keyboards for a year, I've come to the solution that Swype is the keyboard that is most professional and is the fastest way to type for me. No matter if I use both Swedish and English
+ Urban Persson I don't see that as a problem because it's so easy to switch by swiping from the Swype button to spacebar
Ok, but you see on the keys what you get.
+ Urban Persson I think you will learn which key to press the more you using it. And the more you swipe, the faster it will be because it learns what words you use.
Sony rolling out their own todo list, tasks app for the Sony Xperia Z1. Available in update center on your phone
+ Tony Sågare I haven't used it much yet. Released an hour ago But no it's not as good because it's only available on your phone
Notifications works and you can check them off with checkmarks
+ Tony Sågare That's great! You won't be disappointed I have a white too by the way
I've been using this web browser on iOS, it's quite good, now available on Android
After been using the Mugen Power Extended battery for my Samsung Galaxy S3 for some days now, I must say that the thickness comes with an incredible good battery life . This battery is perfect when you need to have power for a little longer period of time than usually. The included back cover also has a built-in kickstand that makes it comfortable to watch movies, or using it as an alarm clock on your desk. Even if it's as thick as it is, the Galaxy S3 still feels very comfortable in your hand. The phone is still actually lighter with this battery, than my new Sony Xperia Z1 is. I can highly recommend this extended battery. Check it out here: And a user guide here: Visit there site here: #mugenpower #mugen #battery + Mugen Power Batteries Italy #samsung #galaxys3
How did Apple recreate the Gold Rush? Here is one more post written by + Micah Howe for Svartling Network . This time it is a bit provocative about the Gold iPhone 5S. I'll agree though that Apple needs to do more than this. It's the same phone as the iPhone 5, but with a fingerprint scanner and new color. #apple #iphone #iphone5s
+ Viktor Sarge As long as you are happy with it and thinks it useful, then there is no need to switch
+ Viktor Sarge I love my Macs but I think they work quite well with my android phones too
+ Andreas Lanjerud Not much use for the 64-bit yet though. It drains battery life quite much though.
+ Andreas Lanjerud The Xperia Z1 camera is awesome, and I am sure that it beats the iPhone 5S camera. It has a much larger camera sensor
+ Andreas Lanjerud and you don't have an iphone 5s yet
+ Andreas Lanjerud I want to see some photos from the iPhone 5s before I say it has a better camera than the Z1, because I don't believe that at all
+ Andreas Lanjerud Yeah and I can't see that the iPhone is better. Not by far
+ Andreas Lanjerud why should I believe them more than myself?
+ Robert Sørensen I haven't needed using the Flash yet. I rather don't use flash they always destroys the photo
Here is another camera comparison: Where the Z1 is better. Especially in low light conditions.
+ Robert Sørensen I see a lot of positive reviews. SO I don't agree on this
+ Robert Sørensen I trust my own experience. The camera is absolutely fantastic, that's my own opinion after using it. It takes some DSLR quality photos.
A rumor says that the Sony Xperia Z1 will get an Android 4.4 update in November - that would be awesome! I love my new Sony Xperia Z1 as you can read in my review of it, but one thing that was not so good, was that it comes with Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, and not Android 4.3. Sony has promised that their latest devices will be updated to the latest Android vers...
+ Saurabh Jaiswal Ok I don't remember where I got it from. It was many years ago ::)
+ Tony Sågare That's true. I have Telia though, and I bought the phone cash.
+ Jonas Björk interesting I haven't dared doing that yet.
+ Maximilian Y. Will probably get the update at the same time as the Z1
+ Jonas Björk lol! I wonder what my wife would think
+ Jonas Björk no I haven't noticed that because I never do calls
+ Jonas Björk Yeah but I don't use it for that. One phone call last year, none yet this year
+ Fergal Stanley I don't know really. I will not do that with my Z1. So I haven't bother to read about that. I have my GS3 to play with ;-)
the new Samsung Galaxy Round compared with Note 3 on video Samsung has announced the Galaxy Round, the world’s first smartphone with a flexible display.

These new Chromebooks looks really nice. And for that price it's a bargain
+ Walter Sterling I like the microUSB charging and the build quality on this one. The Acer will be pure plastic
+ Walter Sterling Yes much better, and I am picky with quality.

+ vinay moharil Agreed, I love my 11-inch MBA and I actually run "Chrome OS" via the Chrome App Launcher with menu and all on my MBA. Best of both worlds. But it would be cool to try this one anyways ;) Maybe + Google can send me one ;)
+ Ellis Z no never, because my Mac can run the same thing through the chrome web browser, with app launcher and all. Best of both worlds. And my MacBook has better build quality and better performance
+ Ellis Z no the cloud can never replace the speed of an ssd drive for example and the technology like video and music it's always one step before cloud, so when cloud finally can work with 1080p video, we already have 4k video format as an example
Motorola DVX will also have Motorola’s X8 computers system with a separate core for natural speech recognition, and that is what I don’t get?

HTC on it's death bed HTC will eventually not survive as an independent company anymore. According to Asymco’s Horace Dediu it’s very rare that manufacturers survive when they start posting losses of their device sales, they usually get bought by larger companies then. That was ...
Yes they make great devices but no one buys them sadly
+ Ellis Z yes that's right, they should have jumped over to android earlier
+ Fahad Suleman that's true but they held on to Windows too long at the same time
+ Dan Forslund That would never happen though
+ Joe Sears Agreed, that's why I like what Sony is doing
+ Richard Querrey that's right, no surprise at all really. Yes it could be a badly run company but it could bee to late to fix that now
+ Steve Okamoto interesting, I wonder what quality issues though
+ Scott Wilson ok, but he has a point that most manufacturer get bought up when they are in the state HTC is in now though
+ Steve Okamoto ok, and personally I really don't like sense
+ Rolf Brandser yeah that is more of a gimmick really
+ Urban Persson Agreed, I am one of them
+ Danni Efraim You can get to your photos from a computer or any device though.
+ Martin Cronier Great. The strange thing is that when I go the the web version of the site it says 5GB free only... but on the phone it says unlimited.. So I don't get it?

+ Tony Sågare + Martin Cronier Ok, I haven't seen that yet. What does the campaign do then?
