from some of the article i read there is some purple fringing in the corner for m mount wide angle lenses with A7R... but the same problem exist for Leica M9. Not sure if A7 makes much difference.
The photo just reminded me of all those times I had to climb to the top to take photos.. only to be obstructed by haze. Ahhh snow cap on Mt. Fuji is a classic
i really like the cover photo for the blog. the characters really help to eccentuate the whole scenery.
+ Martin Irwin alot of korean photographers in korea does something similar. one or two words in a photo in a right place can make a huge difference.
+ Mikhail Kornienko I think that is macro lens.
what lens did u use? i have been looking for macro lense for my NEX 6
yeah 30mm for macro... is only good for food and maybe plants. I heard good things about tamron 90mm macro.
+ Martin Irwin I really need a macro lens.. but after hearing 16-70 and 55-150 ... i have to save ALOT of money.
i was actually planning to do that if Sony ever released 85mm. but don't you loose a bit of light? is it noticeable?
