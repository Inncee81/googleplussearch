I know that's bs sony makes movies tvs computers phones sony is not a mom and pops down the corner they are a big evil corporation like m$ but sony is smaller but smarter just like when it comes to consoles they knew how they could give us what we want (games) and excluded what we don't need m$ isn't concerned with us gamers they just want mass sales from anyone hence the extra shit you pay for and don't use so your question is maybe if m$ don't throw more money at them I'm guessing nintendo ceos would rather sony buy them but they will follow the $
