Electricity was scary, people died switching on the generators at Westinghouse, Tesla fixed it and was awarded millions in stock from Westinghouse, Tesla later gave the stock back when Westinghouse was in financial trouble. Tesla won the Electricity war and powered the entire world's fair using his light bulbs, hydro electric power and no wires. Yet Edison got credit for the lightbulb and distribution of electricity and Marconi originally for the radio, though the radio was given back to Tesla recently.
Marconi was awarded the patent for the radio, Tesla later was given credit for the invention, in 1940's /more recent than the 1800's
+ Alessio Sangalli Tesla had the working knowledge of radio waves and frequencies, it was the use of Tesla patents that allowed Marconi to build the radio and profit from it. Tesla, did not seem to be worried about "WINNING" the financial side, he seemed worried about people profiting from his work and not having FREE electricity and a world wide, ... telegraph? In 1903, the US Patent Office commented: “Many of the claims are not patent-able over Tesla patent numbers 645,576 and 649,621, of record, the amendment to overcome said references as well as Marconi’s pretended ignorance of the nature of a ‘Tesla oscillator’ being little short of absurd… the term ‘Tesla oscillator’ has become a household word on both continents [Europe and North America].”
+ G Nunchuk I don't mean to compare Edison to Bill Gates, but I do.
