The front facing camera can't even compare to the main camera. I have tried it numerous times on my Z1. The rear will pick the right scenes and Iso and focus, it's fantastic.

I've never owned a Nexus phone. I have a Nexus 7 (2012) but I already have a buyer for it because I don't ever have time to use it.My confusion with the whole Nexus 5 thing is; everyone was excited when they saw the leak on the Google Campus and this phone looks EXACTLY the same.
That's the one I use regularly. It picks the perfect scene and ISO, etc... Great pictures.
It is good for the S2. Just can't compare to todays flagships.
Does it charge in the same amount of time or slower?
