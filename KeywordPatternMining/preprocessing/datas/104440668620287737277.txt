Galaxy Note 3 and no matter how the Techbloggers pushed the One Max as they did with the One and it FAILED the Note 3 shall out sell it no matter how they talk about "feel of plastic" as if you won't a case on it
Note 3 I did not even read the article after all I know their specifications and the Note 3 is superior to LG G2 and no misguided person can convince about aluminium outside its the INSIDE that counts
Sadly so far those updates are for the tablets I have the Lumia 820 so may be there will some minor update in store for me
If the Carriers in my country don't do trade ins I would yet would take one when its released so I just have to read about it and wished after all it won't be available in my country that quick
Its Superior to the HTC ONE MAX LG G2 Sony Experia Ultra
You said it for me "its stupid to buy one" I have said it many times only IRETARDS ISHEEP buy the IPhone
None I prefer Phones with Expandable Micro Card slot and removable battery
Oh please the Best Phone for 2013 is the Galaxy S4 after all how can it gets best Phone and your Company in financial lost the Phone is just being praised by dumb Techbloggers because it looks as the CRAP IPhone also the Blackberry Z10 look at it again crazy also the Best Camera Phone is the Lumia 1020
