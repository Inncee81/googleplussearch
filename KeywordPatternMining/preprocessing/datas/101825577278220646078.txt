The very first was an Instamatic using those 35mm (135?) cartridges. Next was a 110 of some kind, then a 35mm instant. Then came the Praktica MTL5B (?). I think I only had the 50mm lens it came with, and later bought a 2x extender. A few years later I saved up my paper round money and bought a Miranda which had the miracle automatic exposure. I went Canon in the early 2000's and bought an EOS 300V. My first digital appeared mid 2000's with a Canon Powershot something, followed by the 400D in around 2007 as a gift to myself before my first trip to France and Italy. That lasted until a couple of weeks ago when I got the 7D which should be my "forever" camera for a while ;).
