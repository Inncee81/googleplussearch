+ Andreas Lanjerud The link and storage limitation you're referred is valid for web playmemories. Not for the Xperia devices! Xperia Z1 owners can upload unlimited photos WITHOUT storage limitation. The only limitation is that playmemories automatically resizes your photos to 1920x1920 if both the height and weight exceed 1920 pixels. See : "Xperia Z1 integrates PlayMemories Online2, a cloud-based image and video service that is integrated into the Album application. A new ‘All Sync’ feature enables users to instantly auto-upload all of their photos without storage limitation3." As clearly stated above other than re-sizing the uploaded photos, there is NO storage limitation. Cheers,
