I like these services reminds me why I haven't paid for Cable since 2009.
I wouldn't even know. I haven't looked at it
Shsssss I hear voices trying to get me to buy the nexus 5 shssss
The new Nexus 7 2014 is effing amazing. Couple of friends bought it and I want one now
It seems to be a hit it miss with the nexus2012 mine is ok no lag and on stock. I know... I didn't root it.

The fact that I'm at work with less then 3hrs of sleep in 48hrs is seriously blasphemy! But it was worth it For any one wondering. A bus ride from Ottawa to Toronto is 5hrs in good condition and if I wanted to be there on time I had to leave at 1AM on Thursday morning to be there for 6am as the conference started at 8am. Yeah I could of taken a plane but not at 600$ for going and coming back. The alternative a trip on a BUS for 70$ was worth it. Got back in to Ottawa at 2am after leaving Toronto at 9h15 leaving behind +Ryan Moore and +Amanda Blain at the #Smokepoutinerie Good times!

If I remember correctly Next Launcher 3D came out before SPB Shell 3D. Also to make a note SPB Shell 3D hasn't been updated since May 24th 2013
Correction SPB Shell 3D was out in 2011. But it took time before any 3D release of the interface.
Also a note is that Next Launcher 3D is also quite active in development of release of updates. I prefer an active team developing and updating constantly to improve the application. But that's just me.
Yeah I have to agree with you! But so far they've done good to keep all the module independent.
I have the following feeling. Both owned by the same entity....
