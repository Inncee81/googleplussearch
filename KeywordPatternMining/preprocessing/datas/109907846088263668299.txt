Ummm.. Nice colors. BUT... I dont think I'd eat the blue, green or purple colors. They'd look kinda gross with red sauce?
You eat it like that? Or with a little butter and Parmesan cheese?
LOL... when I go to my girlfriends to chat... sometimes to help weed and listed to her talk about her "girls"..ie chickens. She never lets me leave without SOMETHING!. My garden is mostly herbs. I try to have tomatoes, various peppers, zucchini, squash, ...basic stuff like that. Next year.... sweet potatoes! ya!
MY dachshunds dont like to be ignored either. They are REAL serious about guarding their yard!
I like this shot better than the one you have posted on Amazon for your "author" page... that one is scarey!
