I'm long past depressing, it's total corruption. I don't even care any longer because I'll be dead before it will ever work no matter who is next elected. We'll flip between one and the other forever and never figure this out. A simple example to sum it all up in one simple "plan". The Presto system, it's been talked about for more than a decade and now that we long last have Presto just so that the far flung bus systems so that we can more easily pay between one system and another. That's all it does, it simply pays for a bus pass and we can't do that properly. But guess which system is still not part of Presto? The TTC. The largest by far system in the whole country which is where most people actually need is the one we can't use. Amazing.
