Being the most liveable city In the world put Sydney's nose out of joint. So the powers that be thought they'd give everyone else a go at the top spot by annoying the hell out of them every time the visited us. I think it's working a little too well!
Either way, if you stare for too long in front of the wife - you'll be shot!
We're happy to follow you +Ananda Sim right here. We'd love to have a great photographer on the team. But our shots are taken without artistic composition, just speed & context, no room for art, just proof. So we must settle for looking at your creative impressions when we take our eyes of the target.
