All throughout my stint in Vietnam, in 1967-77 , I bought a Petri slr 35 at China Beach my only R&R during the one year I was stuck in Danang. I shot different modes but only used film for slides as that was the least expensive and fastest turnaround so I have approximately 300 slides from Danang, up the Cau Viet river to Dong Ha which was the dimilitaryized zone, my trip to Clark Afb in Philipines, then to VungTao, a little town called Cat Lao at the mouth of the Mekong river. I have footage of running 5000 gallon bladders of JP5 jet Fuel up the Mekong being escorted byPBR's (3) in a LCU ( landing craft utility) basically a floating bomb and yes we were scared shitless!!. Delivered to Army bases along the river almost to Saigon. This fuel kept many Huey Helocopters in the air to help our guys out in the heart of the war. This photography is very special to me as I was only 19 years old and completely naive , you might say I was very fortunate to have survived this stage of my life!
The Petri that I mentioned in my first comment was y first SLR AND I cut my teeth on it, through the lens metering was great and it had a 55mm nikor lens!! I got some pretty neat shots of war time action which was not professional but many thought so, not bragging but felt really good that many provided positive comments on my slides
