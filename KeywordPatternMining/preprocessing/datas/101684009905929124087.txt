I uninstalled it today, maybe I'll get it for my kids later on. It's a nice launcher, though. I've been trying a lot of different launchers, but I keep coming back to HTC sense. The best part about aviate was the app drawer, when you move an app to another screen it no longer appear in the drawer, and I really liked the alphabetical slider.
Yes I got a Google music account too, had to "move" to Finland to get it. just had to get it after I got my chromecast.
It looks very nice, and it should perform as well as the regular One. And that means very well One thing in your review, battery life. From what I understand, the snapdragon 800 uses less battery than the 600.. well, I don't know.
Well, yes. More power takes more energy. But, I've read several articles that claims the 800 is more energy efficient.
I guess better than big brother, since it pushes less pixels.
Ok, I've seen the vid now, about the same. But shouldn't it be better? Not that it's bad
It's the same cpu, gpu and ram? In my opinion it should perform a little better. Anyway, it's the most powerful devices out there. I'll be keeping an eye on Sony when it's time to upgrade.
Oh it's not good, and it's sad. I've had the HTC one since April, and I am really satisfied every day. Awesome device.
+ Kristian Wedmark I'm a music lover, and I'm glad they got rid of beats. Some crappy preset equalizer, non-customizable.

Well, I don't use antivirus on my phone. I don't care if I get infected. What's the big deal.
