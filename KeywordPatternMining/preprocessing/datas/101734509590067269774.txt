Just be thankful you have CAA
Our TV is on the way out. We were at best buy the other day checking out the new TVs. You can basically take any TV on the shelf and request for the "dumb" version of it and save you 300 dollars off the sticker price. Worth it!
Glad to hear it worked out! Good son
Let me know what you think, been looking for a pair myself.
Do they do phone calls as well?
Hmmm, might just have to get these. They sound awesome! Thanks
Crap. Last time I did that with with the chrome cast and it cost me double in entry fees and service fees from FedEx then I paid for the actual devices. Thanks for the heads up, I'll look for a way to get them here.
