While it will take quite some more time (years) for me to move from a dslr to a mirrorless, that is undoubtedly what will happen. For me, photography comes down to iq, i dont mind the size and the bulk of dslr´s so i will be keeping my nikon stuff for a very long time. But once i do replace my body, i will buy in to a mirrorless full frame system. And by the time that happens i am hoping that mirrorless will provide vastly better iq and performance then what current ff dslrs like the d800 and mirrorless systems like the up and coming Sony A7r are doing. And by that time, i am hoping Nikon (or Sony, or someone else) will have a proper ff mirrorless that can also take, without iq degradation, my current Nikon ff dslr lenses
