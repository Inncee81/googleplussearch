Nice gallery and subtle colours. It's a real shame that mayde only a few will see it as they need to scroll past more than 16 other "cards" with advertisments, self promotion, news, intros, about us, etcetera etcetera. I understand fully the need to promote yourself in the jungle of online magazines and blogs but the article or gallery at the end of a link should, imo, a lot closer to the top. There are undoubtedly statistics that would confirm that my opinion is shared by others as there are statistics that state that "people" generally will not wait more than 8 seconds for a web page to load before giving up! Please take this "rant" as contstructive critism and know this: I read an article about the x100s on this site before purchasing one.
I'm viewing on mobile + Mathieu Gasquet The "8 seconds" I mentioned were in reference to an article I read about how impatient we all have become. I have not timed how fast your site loads. It loads quite rapidly. Would it be possible include some code that gave visiters on mobile phones the option to view the "mobile version" or the "desktop version". A cookie could be used to remember the choice. I have a Galaxy Note II and normally prefer the "desktop" version of sites.
I can't seem to be able to request the "desktop" version using Chrome. I will try another browser and get back to you.
I have now tried to call up the "desktop" site in three popular browsers without success. These are Chrome, The stock android (Samsung!?) browser and Boat Browser.
Have a look at this site on your mobile phone + Mathieu Gasquet . www.cyberphoto.se It should give you the option to choose which site you want to visit. The mobile site is, imo, terrible, so I only ever visit the desktop site.
I'll be looking out for you prictures.
Excellent I am thinking of a compliment to my x100s with zoom and/or super wide angle.
+ Yael DEFAYE The biggest difference between the two may not be so big! Time and IQ will tell. The cheaper A1 has a "normal" APS-C Cmos sensor whereas this one (M1) has Fujifilm's X-Trans sensor.
Very impressive image quality! None of the "plastic smudging" I sometimes experience with the x100s.
I would love to see this happen. If they could make a screw on wide angle lens wider than 28mm I would be we Feb happier.
