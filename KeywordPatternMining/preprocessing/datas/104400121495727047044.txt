I can't help but think, how long did you spend stood in the trains crumple zone!
Looks like the LG G2 is set to be the N5. Should be sweet. You'll get annoyed with cm though.. Keyboard has some major issues, especially in chrome. :/ You not interested in that CM phone? And who is + Ben Hodgkinson and how do I get this rock and or bum photos?
Have you started watching Breaking Bad yet?
I thought that was the wii-u controller! Hahaha
Is that phone an extension of something?
Yeah.. I'm just bored of stock android now. Its feeling a bit drab. HTC one still on the cards for me.
Hang on now... I never said Samsung! Lol. I think its having the gnexus the n7 and the 4.. All look and do the exact same thing.. Just killed it for me. Though I know I'll end up aosp-ing whatever I do get eventually. If you do get an n4 make sure you get a damn good case!
Oh and you'll need a g1 before I'll let you say you've got the full collection :P
True, but it is the Grandfather of all Nexi.
Hehehe. What on earth would you ever need windows for!?
Doesn't look much better on windows lol! We've been using the mk808s with android. The Netflix quality has gone up loads now days, so its actually useable.
good call, ive been using xbmc + icefilms if i can't find it on uk netflix. And I just found that the yatse remote lets you use voice commands for xbmc. pretty sweet.
My wife says there's a block in your toilet Dave.
"there is now"
