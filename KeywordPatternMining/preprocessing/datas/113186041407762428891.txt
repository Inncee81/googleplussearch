The only advert I've seen for either has been the Taco Bell advert (where you can win one before release) whilst watching us tv the other night. Not seen any UK promotional material for any console other than the 2ds.
I'd love to play this, but at the same time, I can't see the justification in spending Â£250ish to play a slightly enhanced version of a game I already own (still own my original copy of wind walker) Wii U is still lacking that "must have" game
I've been a Nintendo fan since the 64, severely disappointed by the Wii, so not willing to take a chance on Wii U yet. No next gen console has made me think "omg, I have to buy one!" Yet. I think when ff15 and kingdom hearts 3 come out I might have to invest in one. For Wii u, it's going to take a beautiful new Zelda game that doesn't include forced motion controls. Or for new smash bros to not be slowed down and ridiculously easy like brawl. Brawl was such a let down.
I'd love one of these. I'd be able to try all those funky ps Vita games I get through ps+
