That r is similar spec to a d800e and much cheaper AMD smaller.
Wow they missed the boat here.. It's portable and lighter? 2 things I didn't care about from the T1, it's $200 more than the t1. I pre-ordered the first device. Either this is a bad review and they didn't mention better ergonomics, motion tracking, higher res screens and wider pov or Sony have completely missed the market here.. Sort it out Sony! Just give me motion tracking on a t1 and it would be perfect companion for ps4. Cannot believe oculus rift guys are showing you the light but your still trying to target this movie watching bs..
James, thAt sounds great. Lets hope they go 6axis. Nothing outthere to date competes with trackir imo
I want this in the size and ruggedness of an xp active.
Ravi, it be the same in the sea. Like with anything rinse it with fresh water afterwards as the salt water is not good for rubber or plastic if left on.
I couldn't see the release date if you preorder from Sonystyle.. Any eta for USA? Will they stock them in the Sony store at the same time?
Does it have bt 4 or have to wait for android 4.3?

Still enjoying my HMD V1. Wish they added tracking to this new one.
