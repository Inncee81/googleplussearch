This doesn't make me feel better about the US. I just feel sad for all those 14y/o girls who will eventually grow up and realize the error of their ways.
I have a celebrity friend whose received much worse. If you're truly hated - you can rate the rage by the number of death threats a day. You got off easy ... From someone with a twisted sense of humor even. Yes, it's sad that I think it's normal. You just get to a point where you ask, "what should I do, call the cops every day?"
