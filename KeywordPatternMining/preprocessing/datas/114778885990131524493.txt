#save2 Great color and perspective. The all green color pallet works well here.
#save although you missed caturday and focus on the nose, the look and perspective are enough to save it for me. The cat eating sharks are on their way though.
#delete6 The black hole is a bit interesting, and it has a nice duo-tone color pallet, but the composition or something just doesn't have any life or magic to it.
#delete2 I really like the colors and the lighting with the light coming through, but the DOF doesn't work for me here. The lower foreground is so much blurrier than the rest that is bothers me. I think for it to work at this angle more of some of the other outer edge of the flower would need to also be blurred or something. The OOF isn't blurring into smooth loveliness, it is just blurry.
#delete7 The close crop is what does it in. I actually don't mind the bright spot, it's about the closest thing to cow bell the image has going for it. The flags and dome are nice and the rest is very well exposed, it just doesn't have a lot of excitement, but mostly it just feels confined by the crop.
#save7 An unusual dragonfly pose and the curly branch adds a bit of cowbell too. Nice capture of the hairs on his legs and body. A bit of noise in the wing, but pretty nice overall.
#delete8 An interesting place and an interesting treatment, but it just isn't enough to make it work. The thing in the lower right, the building to the rear, and the power lines all work against it.
#delete4 Overall it is a pleasant image. I had a bunch of stuff to say but + Clement Biger said it all already. I didn't even notice the sunset until I read his feedback. That little bit of sky is nice. Getting in tighter might have helped this find a focus.
