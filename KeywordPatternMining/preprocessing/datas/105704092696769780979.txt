I have received my QX10 lens today. Can not connect to app or phone. Tried all day. Have samsung s4. Is it the lens,phone or app. Any good suggestions other than to send it back!!
Have ordered the phone. Very excited. Wanted to know about manual mode using the 20mp. Does this mean that every time I take a picture I have to set stuff like flash, focus, etc. Auto mode is 8pm right? Why not 20mp?
Thanks for reply. I understand more now, thanks. However in manual mode can it be set up how you want and remain in this setting. Thank you kind regards Anna Leigh
