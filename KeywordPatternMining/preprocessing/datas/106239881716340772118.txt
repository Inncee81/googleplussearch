$599 at + Rogers Communications and $699 at + Sony Xperia store? What are you doing to the Xperia Z1, Rogers, that makes it $100 cheaper?
Cal seems to be doing some major damage to battery life. Google Calendar Sync seems to always be running on devices with Cal on them. The Z1 had it even after I uninstalled the Cal app. Factory reset was required to fix it.
I had it on the Z1, but I uninstalled Cal before it popped up. Had it happen yesterday, but didn't know why it happened. Factory reset and battery is fine now. Nexus 4 with Cal started doing the same thing this morning (as above). Only similarity between the two is they both have/had Cal on them.
The worst outcome for my wallet would be if more of you defected to platforms like Apple TV (which happens to be my own gateway to Netflix, movie rentals, and oodles of free programming from sources like Vevo, YouTube, and Vimeo, not to mention streaming music, podcasts, and radio). Or if lots of you plunked down $35 for Google’s remarkable little Chromecast device, which plugs into an HDMI port on users’ TVs and lets them call up content from Netflix, Hulu Plus, Google Play Movies, and the open Web from their tablets or smartphones. Or if you spent more time watching the galaxy of on-demand TV shows available through your Xbox game console. Don’t fall for the talk from Apple, Google, and Microsoft about the freedom and variety of on-demand video! They’re just trying to entice you away from the safe, warm embrace of your cable provider.
For those of you who can't get enough of the music from #gtav
Music Unlimited is actually pretty balls on the Z1. Not great on other Android Devices. That being said, screw you google, sticking with Music Unlimited.
+ Renaud Lepage - They completely integrated the music unlimited app into walkman. music unlimited doesn't exist at all as a standalone app. This is done pretty well, just like Google Play does with all access. BUT this is really only on Sony Xperia devices. Other devices still require a separate music unlimited app to play, which isn't great. Only reason I would pick it over a future Google Play All Access in Canada would be bc I am only paying $12/year for music unlimited premium (normally $10/month)

+ Renaud Lepage - Even if you get it officially unlocked from Rogers, that's still $50 cheaper... Telus and Bell are both selling it at the same or more than Sony Store price.
+ Tom Gray - I'm not really sure what the difference is. I thought buying outright was getting the phone on month-to-month.
+ Tom Gray - What if I already have a number and my current plan?
+ Tom Gray - A hardware upgrade? I have a Nexus 4. I don't have any previous on contract Rogers device.
And if I tell them I just want to buy the phone outright and get it unlocked?
ugh they make it complicated. Sony Store it is lol
It doesn't work like an apple store. Repairs are still done at another location. If its broken you still have to mail it in
No one has done an apple store yet..
We tried that with the Xperia Go. Staff said I had to call for warranty issues. They are just as bad as the rest
Does anyone other than apple so that?

I don't particularly go by any of the user interpretations with regards to announcement/release date, just the coincidence of Kit Kat's tweet and the release date of the Song. I will take that bet and raise you nothing on top.
whatever. Just thought it was an interesting interpretation. With all the crazy stretches people go to predict, this is a pretty believable one.

Camera Comparisons. Currently between Nexus 4, Xperia Z and QX10. Some of the Xperia Z and Nexus 4 shots are HDR, but haven't figured out which ones. I will update this folder with other phones/cameras.
Ya, QX10 by far wins. It's also pulls the more megapixels, giving a more zoomable image. That saying, Sony does need to give more features to it in the play memories mobile app. Only option is auto right now. No manual or other modes like HDR. I can only dream about what the QX100 can do lol

Earlier this week, we told you about how indie ISPs are fighting against Big Telecom blocking Canadians from accessing affordable services. Learn more about how these ISPs are fighting back here: Canadians deserve authentic choice. As Big Telecom continues to block innovators, here's a Canadian company you may want to learn more about - one that can't operate here because of big telecom gatekeepers: Thank you to volunteer graphic designer Miguel Sealey-Cobham for creating this image for us.

Finally got around to putting + Paranoid Android on my Nexus 7. Let's see how this works lol
fist time using PA. I actually thing Halo is perfect for tablets. Probably my favourite feature so far lol
Looks like T-Mobile USA will pick up the Xperia Z1.
The can really only do AT&T and T-mobile anyways, since they are on the GSM bandwagon. This is something T-mobile really needs. They have the amazing plans, and if they can get more exclusives like this, more people will jump on board. More people = more money = more network development.
+ Alexander Maxham - Relative to Verizon and AT&T, T-mobile looks like saints (at least for the Great White North perspective lol). Coverage is an issue that can only be remedied with money. If they get enough subscribers and revenue from them, they can invest in a better network. I would say that T-mobile should probably focus on using up as much of their revenue for network development to really get up there. After that, they can start taking money to the bank.
Also, it seems like Sony wants to spend their efforts strengthening their strongholds vs trying to penetrate new market (ie US and China). After they have a strong presence, they can expand to US and China. Note from article: It seems that T-mobile is the only carrier that has Sony phones. How interesting...

Just some quick samples from the + Sony QX10
+ Johnny Zed - It's actually quite a bit smaller than I thought it would be and very light. From in the pocket to shooting is actually quite slow. NFC is pretty finicky, but not sure if that is just my phone or the device.
We'll see. This is also by no means the QX100, so I don't expect it to preform the best, but I also didn't want to break the bank lol

Studio apartment with trap door to dungeon-like space! (via + Shar Banning )
My Nexus 7 (2012) has become the most frustrating Piece of Shit I have ever used. The anger it brings out in me can not be put into words. It's poor performance can only be rivaled by my Xperia Tablet S. Fuck you Nvidia, I am sticking with Qualcomm from now one because they don't make a piece of shit that slows to a crawl after 6 months of use...
Mine is pretty Jekyll and Hyde. One minute it will be smooth like butter, then the next it will lag on everything. Things will crash. Podcasts I'm watching (video) stop playing when i turn off the screen (correct), but sound will start up again with screen off. I hit the power button maybe 30 times and the screen doesn't turn on. I end up having to hard reboot (this happens very often). It is more Hyde then Jekyll... I am this close to rooting and install custom ROM, but I wanted to help out CM with their new tool. If nothing yet, I will just do it myself.
This is also how my Tegra 3 Sony tablet performs. My Nexus 4 performs circles around both tablets. I don't know if it's warranted, but my blame falls squarely on Nvidia and the POS Tegra 3.
+ Richie Watson - I'm less worried about the new Nexus 7 bc it uses the S4 Pro, same as Nexus 4, and performance on that device is great. No issues at all with slow downs.
seems hit and miss, which is pretty poor on ASUS and Nvidia. Consistency is not something to scoff at. I really want to love my Nexus 7, but it has just become a source of frustration for me. My wife's dual core phone performs better. Even she is like "wow, that's pretty slow" when she looks at my tablet.
+ Alex Keen - No, I think there is some serious issues with it. Some people seem to have no issues while other have major issues. This is not acceptable for a company to release a product with no consistency in performance.
Perhaps I expect too much from mine. Maybe I push it too hard with my Social Networking, Emailing, Browsing, Media Watching and Game playing. Maybe it's all too much for it...
+ Josh Hirner - I would assume so, but am looking at a new phone (either moto x or Z1) and need to convince the wife of that upgrade too lol
+ Gary Mullenhoff - Ya, but I don't want to keep factory resetting every so often. + Ryan Martins - lol, you're funny. Now go over there, grown-ups are talking.

+ Shawn Blais - This is also how my Tegra 3 Sony tablet preforms. My Nexus 4 performs circles around both tablets. I don't know if it's warranted, but my blame falls squarely on Nvidia and the POS Tegra 3.﻿ I was under the impression 4.3 was suppose to fix the TRIM issue (I had noticeable improvement after updating the Nexus 7 to 4.3, but performance has since dropped again. My first Nexus 7 got caught in a bootloop and exchanged with Google for this one. Not too impressed right now...
+ Shawn Blais - I'm less worried about the new Nexus 7's bc they run on the S4 Pro, which has run super great on the Nexus 4. As I said earlier, my phone performs better than both tablets and it's about the same age.
+ Jason Bouwmeester - I can try, but it Jekyll and Hyde's me. I need to use it that way for a while to see if their is a marked improvement. That being said, what is the point of it if I have to keep wifi off?
I'll have a look and let you know
+ Shawn Blais - I can try that, but what I don't understand is why does my Nexus 4, with less than 1 GB or free space and same version of Android perform better than the Nexus 7 with 2.5GB free? I thought 4.3 was suppose to have fixed that issue? Seems to me hardware is where the problem lies...
Thanks for the info. I'm guessing continuous use starts to take it's toll...
+ Massimo Vanfretti - Ya, I started from scratch with 4.3. It was smooth at the beginning, but hasn't gotten this way over time. A factory reset will probably fix it, but will come back in time again.
+ Renaud Lepage - Even if you get it officially unlocked from Rogers, that's still $50 cheaper... Telus and Bell are both selling it at the same or more than Sony Store price.

They seriously need profiles though. That is the one feature I love to use on my PS3, but would love for it to pop up on the Netflix app for Google TV and Android Devices. Do not want my son's shows polluting my profiling lol

I've actually been loving the Z1 so far. I think I will have to buy this one lol Only issue is Calendar Sync has been draining battery super fast. I just did a factory reset to see if that will clear up the problem.
