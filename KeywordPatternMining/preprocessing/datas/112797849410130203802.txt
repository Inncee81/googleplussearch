I'm excited. This has been a heck of a series to watch.
That second inning killed me, + Alexander Maxham ...but it was almost nice to have it blown out of proportion (would've gathered a W). There have been too many pitching duels in a row following the Red Sox and Cards.
+ Mike Yunits calling it as well. Same with cardinals (well let's hope, I'm going to game 6). Now if only I can convince my dad to get WS Game 5 tickets..
The tigers seemed to be cooking down, so I had originally guessed Sox in 6 (because Sox were hot as ever!)..but boy did tiger pitching shut them up. Fun series.
