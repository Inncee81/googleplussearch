could possibly be bad batch "/ being equipped with Gorilla Glass 2 it should be damn near hard to have a noticeable scratch on any N4 if you take well care of it. id suggest RMA and or screen protector if you decide to keep it. good luck
lol id have to agree with + Omar Sa'd but that GG is a marketing term is incredibly incorrect. maybe not as GOOD as they make it out to be but certainly not just a 'marketing term' Corning Gorilla Glass 2 Strength Tested
