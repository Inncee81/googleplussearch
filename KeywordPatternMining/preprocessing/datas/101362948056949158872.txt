+ Sony can you please, pretty please do something about that shutter sound in the official production models because they will be bad for Street Photography. If they are quiet the will be perfect!!! But, from the reviews I am watching on YouTube the sound is terribly loud. Even louder than normal.
What's wrong with the price + Silvio Incocciati ? Have you seen what other Full Frame cameras sell for? I think SONY has priced them amazingly.
No you don't. Sony α cameras have lens adapters for all lenses. You can use Nikon lenses, Leica, Canon, Zeis, Voigtlander and just about any lens you can think of. Check out Metabones adapters + Silvio Incocciati .
Of course + Damien Parker . Sony lenses and all lenses as a matter of fact can be used with ND filters. As long as you know the right dimensions you can get any filter you like.
+ Damien Parker I can't answer that unless + Sony sends me an A7 and some lenses to test and review them + Sony how about it?! Since you are not replying to any questions and I am doing all the work for you, how about you send over some gear so I can learn the system by heart and help all these people out? What do you say!?!?
+ Damien Parker I think I might be getting the A7.
+ Damien Parker the new lenses coming out are from Zeiss ( ) which some say are the best lens developers in the world. Even if they are not the best they are certainly classed as some of the best. So yes, lenses are of good quality. As far as + Sony glass is concerned, I own a few Sony lenses for my NEX-6 and I am very happy with their performance, especially the SEL35F18 and the SEL50F18. They are just sharp! As for the best wide angle lens at the moment, well, are you referring to the existing A-mount lenses or the existing E-mount lenses? If you are going to get the SONY A7 and you don't already own any Sony glass, I would just buy FE-mounts from now on.
+ Silvio Incocciati you can use it but you will get cropping because it is for a cropped sensor.

It looks like Zeiss wasn't the only one with inside info on the A7 + Alan Warren !
I am hooked too + Alan Warren but what about that loud shutter sound?! @#!@$!@#@!
Thank you + Alan Warren but this is just someone's personal opinion. How about you hear it for your self and let me know what you think
I can't wait to hear it first hand also + Alan Warren . If it sounds ok, I am getting it!!
I am still a NEX kid! Also, my NEX-6 is now officially a collectors item! No more NEX coming out again.
