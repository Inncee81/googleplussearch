+ Mark Lastiwka that's also month to month activation. Buyout price may be higher. ﻿ If you try be purchase it through the Rogers website it won't let you buy it without attaching a plan to it.
+ Mark Lastiwka no. 599 if you activate a new number to the service but choose not to lock in for X amount of years. That's how it was explained to me by the Manager of Rogers when I had my Moto X issues anyways.
Then you would have to do a hardware upgrade, or pay a figure above 599 or whatever the carrier store decides to charge.
Then probably a tab. They try to find ways to lock you in.
Then it'll probably be around $699, or what ever the store chooses to price it at.
The 599 deal is for month to month activation and that's another trick as well. It's not a full buyout thus you don't get the 10% discount for bringing your own device, because you bought it "discounted "
Yeah, I would pay more for Sony store. That way if something goes wrong, you can just walk in back to the store rather than that mailing it away BS﻿ Also it won't be loaded with Rogers crap.
Awe lame. I thought they do an over the counter repair or loaner phone at least.
That's total BS. Lol they should take it and send it away for you. At least honor their phones sold at that location.
It's double. Perhaps Android OS has 2 primary processes and added them together incorrectly. Really weird for sure.
Haha. The Classic 7 is a great device, but the New 7 is much slimmer and lighter, it makes the old 7 feel fat and achword. That's what I do though... I push people to buy things lol + Martin Guay and + Cass Morrison know all about that. Don't you guys... lol
Hehe buddy of mine loves Samsung and bought the Note 3 and Galaxy Gear. He's returning them saying he's disappointed this time around. I have a friend in the UK doing the same.

Lol yes. We call Verizon wireless honorary Canadians based on how often they get shafted, that's why they were rumored to come to Canada a month or two ago.
I understand what you're saying. However Android has many users who just little more buttons and switches and will simply install it for the thrill and curiosity.
+ Ryan Moore I know eh. The Chromecast is pretty awesome, but I've switched back to my Google TV, just so I can stream US netflix again.
Thanks. I tried to order one just for kicks and it denied me.
