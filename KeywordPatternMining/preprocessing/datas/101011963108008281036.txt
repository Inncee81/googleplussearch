As a red blooded male and as good as this shot is I couldn't help but be disappointed after reading the title when my eyes got to the image!
I used to think that Gavin but went to see David Hobby (AKA Strobist) in Leeds about three years ago and he told a story at the start of the day. Basically his photographer mate went on an overseas trip with the Bill Clinton entourage as one of the many press photographers and on the last night Clinton threw an end of trip thank you party. All the other photographers took shots of Bill thanking everyone shaking hands with the men, kissing the ladies etc and deleted all those "photos not worth keeping" and to cut a long story short he was the only one a few years later who had a shot of Clinton kissing Monica Lewinsky in the red dress. That shot not worth keeping has bought him a big house with no mortgage and set his family up for life. A great story and I still delete ones I think aren't worth keeping!
