Gordon, you ask about the first, but clearly this is about a trip down memory lane. I recall some plastic toy camera that resembled (roughly) and SLR. I think things like these still show up on eBay today. But I'd have to say my first was a Polaroid One Step. The classic white one with the rainbow down the middle and the red shutter button, and it took what is now known as SX70 film. My dad had two 100-series (?) folding Polaroids that took the 559 (?) type peel apart film ("shake it like a Polaroid picture..."). Never saw him use it, but I played with it and would rediscover them decades later My dad regularly shot with a Yashica Electro GSN fixed lens rangefinder which only had aperture priority exposure. I think there are enough examples on the web documenting this camera as a sort of classic so everyone that doesn't remember it can look it up. I recall him telling me a story of how he bought a 35mm camera and got home and there was no lens. He went back to the store to learn that a lens (like a basic 50mm) was not included in the price. So he wasn't happy and they exchanged it for what I think must've been the Yashica since he said "they said 'here this one comes with a lens'". Too funny! By the early 80s a Canon AE-1 showed up at home, with the 50/1.8 lens to boot! Never did ask who/where/why but we had it and my dad said I could use it. I should mention that beyond focusing a camera (and loading film) my dad seemed to no nothing beyond pressing the shutter button. He never explained the aperture ring to me. So I think I had the AE-1 on 'A' (the aperture ring, it offered shutter priority) most of the time and if it wasn't then I definitely wasn't metering manually. Kept using it into high school. It jammed up once and we had it fixed. Back then people fixed things instead of throwing them away (or selling them on eBay and claiming to know nothing of cameras). In 1990 we "upgraded" to an EOS 750. Traded in the AE-1. Had no clue what a mistake that was at the time. The way it seemed, the 750 offered AF and AE and nearly foolproof film handling. It even had a pop up flash. But all creativity was gone (aside from Canon's depth of field program mode, like the target audience really understood it or bothered to use it). If only the Rebel had been out (a year later). At least then I'd be able to choose Tv or Av or manual, or keep it in Program. Or if we bought an EOS 650. I'd rectify things in a few short years. In college I took pictures for the yearbook and there learned what could be done with a Pentax K1000. The school newspaper and yearbook overlapped so quickly I found out the mysteries of B&W development. I picked up a book or two on photography and started to learn the ins and outs. In 1993 I scraped up the money to buy an EOS 10s. Now THAT was Canon's first 3-AF point camera. The EOS 5 (A2e or something like that here in the USA?) was out but cost more. The 10s had nearly everything except the Quick Control Dial and a 'pc' flash port. The EOS 5 was their first 5-point AF camera and first with eye controlled focus. The EOS-1N followed with the 5 AF points (but never the eye control focus in the 1-series .... hmmm). I got the EF 28-105/3.5-4.5 for Christmas. And later I bought an EOS RT. Canon had the Pellix in the 1960s and the fixed mirror concept is back in Sony's SLT line today. How interesting. I have to be honest, I found a used Canon F-1 (mechanical 1970s version) later in college and that took some of my favorite shots in those years up to the millennium. I also had Yashicamat 124G in the 1990s while in college (and kept it for years). I can't list everything I've had since there was a monthly camera swap meet that I'd go to when in college. That way I could stay a poor-ish student and try many different things. Its the X100 for me today. It is comfy and familiar in that it handles like the traditional cameras I've owned. I don't fight with it. I just ask it nicely to please focus on occasion! I knew all of this going in as I've been following the Fujis since the X100 came out and I only bought my nearly like-new Limited Edition black X100 kit this past summer, for much less than the original new price. With the shade and adapter and leather case it is a good deal nowadays. I had a silver GX1 the previous year but didn't like the JPGs and haven't had much time for PP in the past few years. Your use of the GX1 shows how great it can be in the right hands. But I've gotten lazy lately. But I am watching the GX7 ... niiiiiice. As is the Fuji X system. But it's the X100 and an assortment of 35mm bodies for me for now.
