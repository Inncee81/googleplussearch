I've always found EVFs laggy and impossible to use in low light or with manual focus. Does this camera make any headway in those respects?
When you say of EVFs "they" are great in low light, in my experience no "they" are not. In particular they perform poorly where flash is needed, as what the sensor can see unaided is of no use whatsoever.
Sounds like a genuine improvement then
