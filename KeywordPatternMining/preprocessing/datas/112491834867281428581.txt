wow, my 3 year old SG2 has 48gigs, maybe a tad few millisec slower. but has the parralle effect, I can turn off. can make calls, text, surf the web and all that. Battery will outlast the iphone5s as its changeable, with a similiar or even bigger one. still has a bigger screen. 8mp camera. but no slow motion or any of that fancy stuff. It has FM radio, but sadly this seems to be discontinued on the S4. would I upgrade to a iphone 5S.... well I cannot see any major improvment over my SGS2...
+ Dave Oniel i can;t see any hate, you are being realistic. iphone will suit iphone users best as its what they are used too, and similary to android users. I seen a iphone users go goo goo over ios7 with all the new features, Android users know they had this all the time and can't see the excitement. It is somewaht not the user fault since apple provide such small incremental updates, and lable ity as 'making sure it works before we release it" when often it doesnt anyway. (IOS7.02 out already) yes, iphone is fast, build nicely, and screen size is cmfortable for most users. And they will tell you they never need ato swap battery....because they cannot. I dont swap my battery out often, but I do. Sometime at the end of a day, battery getting low, no time to re-charge , I just swap it out ....its nice to have that option. all the speed and fucntion means squat if your battery dead. the galaxy is plastic? well now apple put out a plastic one, its all quiet on that.
64bit dual core 1 gb ram vs 32bit quad core, 2 gb ram. well technically it should be even...and a real world test (not these homo bench test) says so
+ christopher rizzo i also got a LG P705 this phone is hopeless, battery life is good but is so under power...and the UI to answer is most annoying, I miss heaps of calls.
all i want to know, will the ipad be in gold!
+ c hoss what, what you mean no? its not going to sell unless its gold
and IOS7 make it waterproof too
+ Chris Lau they did, theya said its unapologetic plastic
+ Chris Lau you are right, they dont apologize for anythong wrong, its the consumer fault. its not that cheap either, you might as well get a iphone 5...if there still in stock.
