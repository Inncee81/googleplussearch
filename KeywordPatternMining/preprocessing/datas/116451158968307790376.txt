The phone should be sold unlocked with LTE for that nice $650 price tag that's on it. I can save myself a few hundred and buy any other flagship smartphone and it'll have LTE. Poor move on Sony's part. And they wonder why the US market doesn't favor sony.
If it's only on Tmobile, let's hope they don't make the same mistake by not selling an unlocked LTE version in their stores. It'll be an easy and $300+ cheaper reason to get the Nexus 5
I really hope that's not the case +James King
I'll discover it whenever it gets released in the states.
At the moment, Sony is being a pain in the ass and not releasing their flagship phone in the states. Jus' sayin!
I'd love to share with my friends, but you guys dont sell it here in the Sates yet, so I cant purchase one. Sony should really hurry up with that...
I want the C6906 version, the one compatible with AT&T LTE.
Here in Orlando, its garbage service. Sadly I'll need to wait!!
Thats because you dont have AT&T. If I had the garbage that Tmobile puts out, I'd purchase it too, however I'm with a much better provider, in my area, of course.
+ John M Catral you, bascially. You got the 6903 version, correct?
When I say garbage, I dont mean phone lineup. Its mainly implied for their service. Many of the same phones go across the different carriers. Where I live (Orlando) TMobile is barely better than Sprint, which is by far the worst of the 4 main carriers in the states.
+ John M Catral and while the new Nexus 5 looks like it'll be great, I'm just concerned about the camera. It was my backup choice from the Z1 if they were to improve the camera greatly. Many say its average at best. Also the 2300mAh battery is worrisome. For a phone that has the same hardware as the Z1, the G2, and other larger phones, thats a small ass battery!!
Gotcha. I'm in Windermere and it's god-awful around here. My neighbor, who ironically works at a tmobile store, complains about service around here all the time.
+ Kris Stone I'm in the same boat... It makes me mad
