No source listed for the "leaked" telus photos? Seems awfully fake to begin with.
+ Emmanuel Baafi who knows, its a poorly written article so I wouldn't look too much into it. To me, the phone icon ties in well with Google's new flat icon design so I can't see anything questionable about it.
+ Walter Sterling is correct. I haven't seen any Telus nexus devices with carrier splash screens. I'm also using a Koodo n4 (Koodo is part of Telus) and mine did not come with any kind of carrier branding.﻿ Edit: also worth mentioning that there are at least two images provided with the Telus logo (one portrait, the other landscape). When did splash screens start auto-rotating?
