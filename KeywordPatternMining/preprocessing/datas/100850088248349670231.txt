Trey, thank you very much for sharing all this. I went through a similar process with the camera selections, D300, Fujifilm X100, Nikon D600 and Sony NEX-7 which I really like in combination with 'old' manual Focus lenses. However, after one year of use the display of my NEX-7 looks like this: The anti-reflex coating is gone - the display became mirror-like ;-( hard to use in some ambient light conditions. I don't have such a problem with my other cameras (maybe a small scratch but not like this). How about your NEX-7 ? Any issues? After talking to Sony when I was told, this would be normal wear-off and I (!) should have used some protective coating, I decided: never buy Sony again - but reading about the A7R I could be tempted..
