+ Tim Kisker I have the 1.0 revue and it's so wretched that I bought a roku and just quit using it. I really like this sony one and so does my partner. I heard there was an updated remote you can buy that is voice activated which sounds pretty cool to me. My only complaint is the remote. It's good because it does what it should and is easy to use but I can't hold it in my hand for very long - it's just too wide. But, I'm spoiled and used to TiVo remotes.
