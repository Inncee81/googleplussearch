You forgot our extortionate tax + Stuff - the 16gb is the same price as the 16gb from last year. So it will be £279 for the 16gb. 32gb model will probably be £329 or something.
Yep, absolutely! - I decided a year ago I was only gonna upgrade to the Nexus 5. + Stuff (don't mistake that - this is my next phone - period!) But if Google like to seriously slash the price - the G2 is only £399 at three. So its gonna be around £70 difference (£60 once googles tenner delivery is added) between the 32gb models. (N5 vs G2) But if the FCC specs are fact - the £60/70 (or so) doesn't show such a low price impact like last years Nexus 4. N5 could very well be smaller battery, worse camera and smaller screen - so this could be the £60/70 difference. What I was trying to say is maybe Google ain't being as price-crazy this year.
Plastic phones are now cheap? + M Butler Not all plastic phones are like Samsung's! HTC ONE X Moto X Nokia Lumias ... Just to name a few. All are very nice, pretty phones that are well made.

Funny how a Samsung fan talks of Google trying to control the crowd, brainwash and lock down the OS + Nic Moore Let's see: Flash counters Region locking Smart watch that only works on 1 Samsung device Their own appstore Tons of gimmicks that barely work & nobody uses - purely to differentiate. .... Working on their own OS too Cheating benchmarks for reviews Writing false reviews for their competition Holding hardware drivers and source code back for developers S-Voice .....Seriously? Making several versions of the same phone - each slightly better than the last (how many different S4s are already out there now?)- good way to keep your customers happy. Could go on.... Whos the pawn? - Samsung make the removeable batteries - of course they want to sell extra ones! - fallen for it yet? They use the thinnest glossy shiny plastic as its the cheapest. They now make plastic that imitates Faux Leather that imitates real leather - they've done this for plastic-looking-metal too. They spend a fortune on marketing, similar to another company... So try again - who's like Apple? Whos locked down?
