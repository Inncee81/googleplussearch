Yep, in most cases your 'full frame' glass will work from whatever brand - the trick is having the right adaptor... while all E-mount adaptors will fit, unless you've got a fairly new one it's likely to be designed for a smaller APS image circle (you can generally tell just by looking at it). The A7/r actually lets you "force" full-frame mode with any lens, although most of the current E-mount models suffer pretty serious vignetting when you do this (and otherwise the APS mode drops to 10/15MP images). As an aside, the sensor is designed specifically to work with those old 'film' lenses (which focus light at a fairly steep angle on the edges of the sensor) - I've only had limited time to experiment so far, but I've been reasonably impressed ...oh, and Sony lenses-wise, just consider the range we're launching with a primer - plenty more to come...
