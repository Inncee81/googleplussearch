Looking good fellas. Glad you had fun with the GX7. I'll be finishing up my review on it very soon. Love the IQ in this camera.
That's awesome. I gotta find some of my 80's video game pics and put that online.
Fun shot. Looking forward to hearing how you like the GX7. Have fun, I know you'll give it a workout.
+ Gordon Laing I can never have a large enough EVF and the IBIS works but it's been so long since I shot with the EM5 that I kinda forgot how effect their IBIS is. I think down the road you'll see more advanced IBIS in the Lumix bodies as well as larger EVF's. The coming year is going to be red hot for photography. Can't wait!
While I'm an avid Apple user the Surface Pro II looks really cool...but wowza that's a booboo.
