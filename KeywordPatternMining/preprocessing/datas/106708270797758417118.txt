#delete9 Colors are great, lighting is interesting - but that's about it. A photograph should appeal to your emotions. Should the audience want to visit this place? Are we interested in seeing more images of where this is from? Suppose you were paid to create a sequence or slideshow of these images - what would keep the viewer motivated to advance to the next image? I think these are good questions to keep in mind, when shooting. Always ask what the point of the image is, what you're trying to accomplish, and why you're taking the image at all. Like some of the above commenters have suggested, the image lacks a center focal point, meaning, there appears to be no specific reason for the composition. Absent good composition, the eye just 'wanders' around the image, looking for a central focal point. A for effort. The only way to improve is to continue shooting.
