+ Daniel Ghio not much of a photographer and you have the Z1? Lol. Anyway, I'm similar in that I'm not much of a photographer either but I do love music. I heard that Z1 was gonna have a good audio chip but it didn't turn out that way. Now I am disappointed and I don't know if it sounds any better than my Z.
I use the MW1 which I had only purchased for their 'smart' functions cuz I was planning on buying the Ultra. I was pleasantly surprised by their great sound which I just wasn't expecting! Been using them with my Z ever since.
+ Daniel Ghio true that. But I personally prefer the Ultra and was all set to buy it until I read that it's sound is not so good. Now I'm contemplating the Note3 or maybe just hold on to the Z for now.
I heard that it's much bigger than SBH50, which is not good. Then they say that SBH80 is to be announced soon. Let's see.
