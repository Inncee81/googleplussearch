+ Jason Hermann are you going to review this lens ? there don't seem to be too many changes compared to the V1. I wonder if it is worth an upgrade. I have the same question for the 70-400 which for now I keep the old one
well nano coating is another word for "photo ferries dust" the limiter today is either all or 3m to infinity and the A99 to specify any other range. The AF would have to be dramatically better to justify that lens. Had they not done the A99 firmware update then it would be a definitive yes
+ Jason Hermann I am only "missing" 3 lenses from the Sony line up. unfortunately they are neither cheap or easy to jutify zeiss 85mm, Sony G300.28 Sony G 500mm f4.5
+ Jason Hermann LOL I know just need to break into a bank
I was going to recommend this as my new begginer camera. It is a little pricey for that. I will still recommend a bridge for any new photographer. 300-500$ to get a 20-800mm lens is hard to beat. This may be next natural step before moving into an interchangeable camera system
Well my take is for 300$. you get a camera to get you started. See if you like wide angle or zoom and options to play with manual settings, and filters,... Once you outgrow the camera you still have a compact camera to take along. I know too many people who get an entry level DSLR and kit lens of one fixed lens (usually a 50mm 1.4) and who are not happy with their kit and it limits how they can grow. Yes bridges have flaws but they take pretty decent pictures. Here a picture with the hx100 AF iso 3200 at night not sure the a99 would have done a better job. https://plus.google.com/app/basic/photos/104945048045602245646/album/5931387983248880497/5931387987355609538?cbp=w40de8w8lpoj&sview=20&spath=/app/basic/photos/104945048045602245646/album/5931387983248880497&sparm=cbp%3D167zf7k1zjls3%26sview%3D21%26spath%3D/app/basic/photos/104945048045602245646/album/posts%26sparm%3Dcbp%253Dnww0thaytfnf%2526sview%253D21%2526pgpnum%253D2%2526spath%253D/app/basic/photos%2526sparm%253Dcbp%25253Drc7fc3yscu6c%252526sview%25253D21
+ Valery Dyck well given the 24-200 f2.8 lens. The price is justified but not for a beginner cam. I see a lot of people starting with the hx300 and the serious people upgrade to the RX-10. Yes a few may go DSLR A-mount or the new A7 E mount. It makes it natural. The RX-10 for me is a lot better than many entry level DSLR's with kit lens
Looks very promising. I guess most people get hung up by the new zoom lenses being "only" F4. The RX10 should be the new default camera for any advanced amateur who want a great zoom lens and compact package

If you ever plan to upgrade to the a77 or a99 and you need focus accuracy. Then I would save up for the latest Sony lens the af-d mode with the new lenses is breath taking. Limit the range of where the AF will try to focus. Great subject tracking. My sony 70-200 was initially not supported and when the firmware fixed that it was like a new lens
