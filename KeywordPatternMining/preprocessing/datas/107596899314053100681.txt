+ Alexander Maxham hell the stock ROM on the lg optimus g pro is just as fast. + Colin Null I've got a good friend who wants a note 3 I flat out told him unless ur gonna ROM it the g2 is the way to go Lg just makes better shit. Better build quality (don't believe me its time to watch some drop tests) and the software is superior even tho they don't update it...
+ Colin Null optimus g pro is, and "this devices maintains noticeably faster framrates on average" is a quantitative fact ;)
Touchwiz does lag. Even with a different launcher switching between apps lags because touchwiz is still running in the background... Don't be a fanboy man even long time Samsung users will admit this although I gotta say the note 3 handles it better than anything before it.
Optimus ux maintains higher framerates when compared to touchwiz. In fact I've seen options g's that are snappier than note 3s and optimus g is snapdragon s4 pro. Its also just as functional and stable. The numbers tell a similar story as lg has been up over 100% sales year over year (lg is +130% and samsung is +32% if i remember correct) and Samsung seems to have hit the peak of its merchandising cycle and is steadily declining in sales growth. You can try and sell that story to those less informed but u are most certainly wrong and the numbers prove it. And if u need further proof hit xda or YouTube...
