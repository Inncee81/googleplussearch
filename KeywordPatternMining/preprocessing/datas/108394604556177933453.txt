Yup, number of times I'd lay the blame on RM when I was only dispatching twice a week yet advising customers I was dispatching daily. Got very few direct complaints about it and the 1st class service was 99% of the time next day judging by the feedback we got. That was quite a few years ago though...
got caught up in the traffic due to this just after 7pm, looked like west bound had been reopened but traffic was still snarled up. Also heard a rumour that 'drink' was involved, despite the driver being reported as tee-total....
+ Martin ReadingSenór Vape I've seen a number of 'notifications' of this, including one that appeared in my notifications box. I also expect to see a few more. Though due to confusions between 'highlighted' posts and 'endorsed' plus 1's I can understand why many are confused. I've yet to decide if I am willing to share my endorsements, but I definitely don't want to force the stuff I plus on G+ into the streams of my circles.
+ Adrian Chapmanlaw it's not just reviews that would be classed as an endorsement. It's when you have plus1'd on a webpage, or 'followed/+1'd a brand/business on G+.
