#save7 Well done. Impressive capture; beautiful color and symmetry. Wider might be better, as + Nev Nels said.
#delete7 Ditto re the focus. And it being a shame, because the picture itself is funny and wildly different.
#delete3 The top half works well, and the bottom half shows promise, but feels lost. In other words, I agree with + Nev Nels
#delete Feels soft, noisy, and a bit oddly composed.
+ Alexei Tolkachev Uh no. Evocative of the fabric (thin, wrinkled). This is going off the rails! Back to voting!
#delete6 Nice macro, but needs some more saturation and contrast. A little flat.
A new word. Fun. I can add that to "twig" and "dutch angle," from the past week. The new words tend to come from Andrew Webb-ster's. + David Swica + Andrew Webb
#delete9 I like this better than most of the deletes. It's a well organized composition. I don't mind the washed out colors, and I really like the framing and sharpness of Daniel Webster. But it's the sky and the flare that keep this from a save for me.
It's not just the pole. There is a definite (perceived, if you prefer) leftward tilt to the house. It would be improved with a small CW adjustment.
#save6 It needs some more contrast, I think; but nicely done. Great texture.
