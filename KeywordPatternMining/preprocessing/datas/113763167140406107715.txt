That whole exchange is pretty darn funny. I'm so glad I bailed on VZW and went back to TMobile.
+ David Blackwell By the time I paid TMobile almost HALF as much money as Verizon (and moving to an unlimited data plan at that), I was money ahead to just pay my ETF early on and leave VZW behind. I've never regretted the decision.
