I've learned a couple tricks over the years for laying them perfect. The number one enemy is dust particles and alignment! Sounds obvious but wipe the device down super good with an electrostatic wipe. Try to be in an area with moist air and definitely not under an AC vent or fan. This may sound completely ridiculous but I place my screen protectors on my devices in the bathroom. I run a hot shower to make sure the air in the bathroom is moist. This will weight down whatever dust is in the air so it won't cling to the screen or the screen protector. Next I peel back just a little of the film from the sticky side and align it as perfectly as possible with the screen edges. Screens with squared or close to squared edges are of course easier. Then I take an applicator card or credit card with cloth wrapped on it and run it down the face of the protector as I peel the film away from the sticky side of the protector. This will make sure there is little to no air bubbles or particles trapped between the screen and protector. Whatever minor bubbles are left can be pushed out the edges of the screen protector with a card. Viola! Perfect application!
Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that's a Sony Smartwatch
I'm really considering a smartwatch as my next gadget. Haven't really chosen the one I want yet. So far the Hot Watch has me the most interested
