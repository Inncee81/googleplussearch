There are already droves of people modifying lenses to use them on their FF bodies. Even if the camera didn't have autofocus, it would still sell. The alternative is what, a Leica? It's about $7k for the camera and EVF, and won't work with most lenses. The world needed a FF with a short registration distance. The rumor is that the A7r won't have PDAF, although the recent high-end NEXs do all have it. Assuming it's true, people will still be using it for moving targets, just as they have the older NEXs. It isn't meant to replace the DSLR, unless you're the buyer who is willing to accept the tradeoffs. It depends on how you shoot/what you care about.
+ Christian Schwarz The "quality" is (mainly) the technology. Olympus and Panasonic teamed up, but that hardly makes them linux. I totally agree quality matters, which is why we're excited about FF over APS-C. The thing is, that extra sensor real estate is the same as the improvement of APS-C over mFT. To mind the nominally open company is Canon, who hasn't really gone out of its way to kill off Magic Lantern.
