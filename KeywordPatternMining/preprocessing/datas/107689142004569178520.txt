+ Joe Phelps 1) Most of those updates are most likely NOT for Win8 2) The updates install at the most inopportune times(see my post above) 3) Why should an OS need to double in size from ship date to setup? 4) If you don't understand now then you must be related to Bill Gates
I didn't say they weren't for Windows .... I'm suggesting they are not for Windows EIGHT
If you check the updates available for windows (any version) you will usually see several listed for a different version than you are running or for other MS products. If you allow auto update it will download and install all of them.
That kind of stuff happens every time. I dropped $599. For my ps3 box after waiting to see if it dropped.... Guess what? It did.. Less than 2 months later you could buy the same one for $299.
+ Katy Kasmai yes it is a reference to the nexus 5 with Android Kit Kat. With the hundreds or maybe thousands of post I assume anyone who has been on G+ for more than 60 seconds would see them. ï»¿:-)
+ Katy Kasmai lol I'm not talking about anything but the post. It appears that someone leaked the information about it early.. Hence ... Pushed the button too early.
