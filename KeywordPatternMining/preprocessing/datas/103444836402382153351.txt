And isn't that why we ALL have had to pay taxes all these years? OH! I forgot. They decided to spend the money we sent them on other things. So now THEY WANT MORE OF OUR MONEY! Get a grip Washington. We don't want to keep giving you more of our income, whether from our own businesses or our jobs. STOP SPENDING MORE! There is NO acceptable rationale for wanting more and more and more of our money. OH! I forgot. YOU WANT POWER. We are your serfs and you will continue to send your tax collectors until we have nothing left. We fought to get away from England for that very reason. Is Washington becoming the new England? Food for thought!
+ John Pozadzides Get the Tardis ready !!!!! I'm on my way to escape from the Daleks, I mean Socialists, who are in charge of our government.
I'm with Dave R. Stick with the GEEK, John P.
Sorry, John P. But that is not in good taste.
I believe in Jesus Christ as my Savior. ANY jokes using His name are inappropriate. Deal with it ! ! !
