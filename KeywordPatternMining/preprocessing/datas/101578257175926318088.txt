It's really hard to look only at her eyes ;) and I'm not sure the focus point is there... am I wrong?
+ Eric Adeleye I really like the composition and the lighting of the picture. I just feel that the face is a little bit out of focus and I don't know if you did it on purpose or not. The point is that since the face is a little bit out of focus my eyes are wandering and are attracted by the legs (well I'm a male...) then go up to the hands and back again to the face and it goes on and on... To make it short I think your picture is really great because I can't take my eyes out of it (and not only because of a male behavior). Was the face slightly out of focus a choice? By the way I went through your pictures and I found some self portrait really stunning, especially the one with the rope. Have a nice day and a holly Sunday tomorrow.
