I haven't had any av program or app on my phone or laptop for over a year. If anyone can find any malware or a virus on either please do. The only thing that has changed is my devices run faster and my batteries last longer. But if you are gullible enough don't pay for it there are free av products out there that are just as good if not better than what you will pay $50+ for. My personal recommendation is Avast for both phones and computers. You really can't beat the features you get for free or the price.
