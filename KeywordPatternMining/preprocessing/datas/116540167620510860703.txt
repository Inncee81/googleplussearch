Cali I love you but either you love ugly things (which would explain why you hang out with certain people and in which case I must say "sup?") or this is a horrible picture cuz this case looks far from attractive.
Are you guys seriously complaining about the validity of the picture????
I do prefer my women with more meat but I'm not going to complain about these either. Certainly not anorexic in my opinion.
+ Dave Robinson Nobody is forcing you to click on the picture, much less read the comments, you could simply uncircle + John Pozadzides or simply ignore the picture as you scroll by. You can also tell your daughters that their daddy is a selfish troll who likes to go on G+ and complain whenever he sees something he doesn't like. Seriously dude, don't like it? Ignore it or uncircle, simple as that.
+ April Baum I agree, this picture is made mostly for men, certainly not all men, but a lot of us love seeing a beautiful woman. It certainly doesn't mean that this is what we expect a woman to look like, it also certainly doesn't mean that this is what we expect to get at home. I can personally say that as hot as I feel these girls are, they are certainly not the type I'd like to marry.... mostly because the woman I marry will hate the gym as much as me lol. Personally I appreciate that even at his age + John Pozadzides still appreciates a womans body as much as a much younger perv like myself.
