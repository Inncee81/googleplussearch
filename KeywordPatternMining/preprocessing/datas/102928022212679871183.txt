I own a galaxy nexus and I use almost 80% of nexus device (missing the nexus q ) I watched this conversation and I found a bit of aggression between 2 android users , that made me want to tell that the note 3 is of course a flagship and one neat device that do extraordinary stuff that no other ✆ phones can do specially with such a pen .... The difference between nexus and other devices is not only I get the software earlier but I am also able to develop without losing warranty .... Easy to customise freely and no bloatwares .... Some of my friends bought the nexus devices and they didn't like it for small features like call waiting and swipe to dial .... So even small specs have their own customers .... Be calm people technology is getting more exciting to serve what we need and for sure our needs are different in which the best device is an illusion as there is the best for everyone ☺
