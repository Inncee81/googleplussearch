Do you shoot jpeg only or did you do some RAW? I'm trying to compare this camera with the NEX 6. I know the Fuji lens is better than the Sony.
Are you going to compare the X-M1 with the X-A1? I don't the the difference between the 2.
I have found a review of the X-A1: You can compare 2 images at 6400 ISO from the X-A1 ( ) and the X-M1 ( ).
yeah, that's why I'm thinking about that X-A1, they did a great job in noise with an APS-C sensor
Me too! I'll check your website for further update!
