Windows 8.1 is an exceptionally good operating system. I'm a full on Start screen convert and the notification system seems to be brilliant. When I get a Facebook notification, I can click the box and the screen automatically snaps to half and half showing the Facebook message thread. Being able to move full screen programs across multiple monitors and snap both screens with a Metro app and the desktop is brilliant. The programs all automatically adjust for their new aspect ratio. I have Ubuntu installed on my laptop and regularly use OSX and Windows 7 on my work PC. My home computer with Windows is easily my most enjoyable user experience. I'm now convinced that I want to switch my Android phone for a Windows Phone and will consider getting a Surface 2 if I want a tablet. I'm looking forward to seeing how the Xbox One integrates with the whole environment too. Microsoft have already shown off Miracast support between Surface Pro, Windows 8.1and the Xbox One. My only problem so far is with my Asus PCE-N53. It is not compatible with Windows 8.1 so I was having the IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL install error until I removed the card. fortunately I have a dual band USB dongle.
