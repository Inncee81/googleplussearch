I think the whole Marketplace website would go better if they hadn't used the same government contractors that have consistently failed at their projects every time they have been given one. I mean.. Booz-Allen? They don't even know what a root account is supposed to be for (re:You're not supposed to have thousands of them). SAIC? They have consistently failed at every project put in front of them, and yet are still given contracts. And those are only 2 out of about a dozen contractors on that system.
No, that would imply that the website ever worked, in the first place.
Nixon didn't really put any of those practices into place, he really just abused the hell out of them after they were already established. Obama is similar, since many of these programs were put into place in the Bush administration, but really he is more of a builder than an abuser. More funding, more programs, etc etc. Bush Adminstration, part Deux. The real danger will come at some future date, when the next true reincarnation of Nixon takes the reigns of power, with the programs that are in place, and really begins to abuse them in earnest.
