I think my photography adventure probably started before you with a Kodak instamatic (a flat one with single use flashes - the camera got stolen), then I used my father's cameras : a pre SLR Rpyer Savoy - all manual then a canon AL1 (stolen), then a mainolta 600Si Classic then I went into the digital world first a Minolta Z1, then a Canon 350D, 40D and 7D. I also two canon pocket camera : an IXUS L1 and an S90.
