Looking forward to getting better use out of my dual screens. Otherwise I don't think it is going to make too much difference to my iMac.
+ Stefan Svartling I wouldn't mind a MacBook Air but I spend a lot of time in front of my iMac 27" and when not there I have my mobile devices to use. The only occasions where a MBA would be great for me is when I am out and about and I would like to do some proper dictation with Dragon Dictate. I know I can dictate on my Android devices and on my iPad but it is nowhere near as good as the real thing on + Dragon Dictate .
The full version of Dragon Dictate that works on Mac OSX is so much better than any mobile version of the application.
Mind you I prefer to dictate on the Android with the dictation I get from SwiftKey than using the iOS dictation on my iPad.
Yes I did try DragonDictate in Swype, but I didn't think it was anywhere near as good as the desktop version. I might go in and have a look and see if there have been any improvements though.
