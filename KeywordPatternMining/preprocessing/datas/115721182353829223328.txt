Is it worth it ? Yes definitely. Now I just need a case for when I'm at work.
+ Adel Alsbeehi you should of held out alittle longer , as the nexus 5 is about to show. Pure Google is easy to obtain after rooting.
+ Adel Alsbeehi I was just saying as if you've only just purchased it? It is a smashing phone I bought 1 for the wife last year and she loves it, so much I offered her my old note 2 when I got the 3 and she still doesn't want to part with it. If I was about to make a purchase at this moment in time though? I would of held out for nexus 5 and paid the few extra £/$ .﻿ but that is me ...enjoy it is a great phone.
