+ Jasbir Muker Wind Mobile isn't $40.00 Canada wide. It's $40.00 inside their tiny calling areas. If you leave them, you pay per minute on top of the $40. I live in Ottawa. Wind doesn't even cover all of Ottawa. Where I live, if I were to call people while on Wind at my home, I would be paying extra. That's not $40 Canada Wide.
You're right! I also wouldn't get any calls either! Did you even read what I wrote?
