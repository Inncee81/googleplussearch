+ Anthony Stewart New Egg @ www.newegg.com has all the Xyperia Phones Ulocked and with both Price Match and Buyer protection. It you want the Z1 Ultra Unlocked it will work on AT&T 4G LTE. Definitely a much better choice than the others who can run it in the USA.
+ Fernando Gonzalez I too held out for So Long , and then one day an I.T. pro in this group pointed out that after a certain level of Spec's it's more of a meaningless contest, and that he also had the Nexus 7 tablet which has a lot of features too. I was about to switch from Verizon who I have been with 7 plus years and Motorola who I have been with since their first Android phone. It was a reality check and wake up call. I went to the Verizon Store got the Motorola MAXX with a 3500mah battery as I am a high end user. I run it hard everyday, often with WI Fi hot spot on all day. I have yet to not make it through 14 to 16 hour day. I need my phone for receiving calls and the Wi-Fi hot spot. When I saw that New Egg is selling the Z1 ultra, which ships on the 14th I was pumped & they have price guarantee too, and offer protection packages which is important when you buy a $700.00 phone that is not off the shelf. The bummer is that Verizon cannot or will not announce if they can run this phone. I am an in a Rugged Industry as an Executive. The DROID MAXX does everything the MOTO X does but with 32GB on board, quad core snapdragon processor, and quick draw camera like the MOTO X. Unless you are trying to compensate for something else, then nothing should be more important than functionality. We all know That T Mobile is a joke and to top it off the just recently bought Metro Cellular who offers a 4 line unlimited plan for $100.00 a month. For me, my job is to answer my phone. In 7 years I have missed less than 5 calls on Verizon, I know people on The T Mobile that miss that many daily. I have been at the beach with them, no signal, can I use your phone. I have been at hunting camps in the Middle of no where and watched them hop on a ATV to go to the top of a hill to try and get a signal. Cell service is like all things in life, you get what you pay for. The only guys I see arguing about Spec's are, let me be politically correct, they do not appear to be Suave, I wanted this phone, was even willing to switch carriers, finally one cool guy on Google Plus put me in my place, and the next day I was at Verizon so I could switch to their Edge Program so I can upgrade as often as I want. You be the judge but I will take the best service over the best Spec's everytime. I am confident, my esteem is not tied to my device, sure the Sony is an Incredible Phone, but I do not plan on using it for underwater photography, and if my Verizon phone goes down I make one call and there is a new one at my office the next morning. Try that with Sony. I have a lot of love for Sony, since the early 1980's when I bought my first Walkman to now with 2 Brava TV's, two surround sound systems, and two blue ray players. I hope one day they get on Board with Big Red, but until then I will go with who has never let me down. I hope this makes sense and Thank the group for allowing me to put my 2 cents in.*Respectfully*
, + Fernando Gonzalez It sounds like you have a plan, and that is what is most important. Too many people get caught up the SPEC race, and unless you are an Eagle to odds of seeing the difference between 350PPI, and 410 are pretty darn slim. If you are solely Metro based T Mobile has those areas covered, since you have the Wi-Fi and understand VOIP, you should be good. I have a lot of respect for Sony, and even contemplated dropping Big Red, fortunately my Employer pays for all communication devices, and I am blessed, but also cursed as part of my job description is to be available at all times. As a borderline tech geek, and information Junkie I am always drawn to the latest and greatest, then they hit the market, the reviews come in, and some time things change. I think 4th quarter is going to have a lot of offerings as the Phablet officially enters the market through many brands. Only you can decide what works for you, and as Flavor Flav, said, ''Don't believe the hype''. You seem really bright and tech savvy so I think you could probably get any device to serve it's purpose. I wish you the best, and Thank you for reading my long post. I type 60+ words a minute, so often before I know it I have posted a long comment. One thing, if you do get the Sony, I would probably recommend New Egg, as they offer a protection plan for a little extra, but when you spend $700.00 on a phone, you need protection. I wish you the best in whatever you choose. *Respect*

+ Anthony Stewart New Egg @ www.newegg.com has all the Xyperia Phones Ulocked and with both Price Match and Buyer protection. It you want the Z1 Ultra Unlocked it will work on AT&T 4G LTE. Definitely a much better choice than the others who can run it in the USA.
+ Fernando Gonzalez I too held out for So Long , and then one day an I.T. pro in this group pointed out that after a certain level of Spec's it's more of a meaningless contest, and that he also had the Nexus 7 tablet which has a lot of features too. I was about to switch from Verizon who I have been with 7 plus years and Motorola who I have been with since their first Android phone. It was a reality check and wake up call. I went to the Verizon Store got the Motorola MAXX with a 3500mah battery as I am a high end user. I run it hard everyday, often with WI Fi hot spot on all day. I have yet to not make it through 14 to 16 hour day. I need my phone for receiving calls and the Wi-Fi hot spot. When I saw that New Egg is selling the Z1 ultra, which ships on the 14th I was pumped & they have price guarantee too, and offer protection packages which is important when you buy a $700.00 phone that is not off the shelf. The bummer is that Verizon cannot or will not announce if they can run this phone. I am an in a Rugged Industry as an Executive. The DROID MAXX does everything the MOTO X does but with 32GB on board, quad core snapdragon processor, and quick draw camera like the MOTO X. Unless you are trying to compensate for something else, then nothing should be more important than functionality. We all know That T Mobile is a joke and to top it off the just recently bought Metro Cellular who offers a 4 line unlimited plan for $100.00 a month. For me, my job is to answer my phone. In 7 years I have missed less than 5 calls on Verizon, I know people on The T Mobile that miss that many daily. I have been at the beach with them, no signal, can I use your phone. I have been at hunting camps in the Middle of no where and watched them hop on a ATV to go to the top of a hill to try and get a signal. Cell service is like all things in life, you get what you pay for. The only guys I see arguing about Spec's are, let me be politically correct, they do not appear to be Suave, I wanted this phone, was even willing to switch carriers, finally one cool guy on Google Plus put me in my place, and the next day I was at Verizon so I could switch to their Edge Program so I can upgrade as often as I want. You be the judge but I will take the best service over the best Spec's everytime. I am confident, my esteem is not tied to my device, sure the Sony is an Incredible Phone, but I do not plan on using it for underwater photography, and if my Verizon phone goes down I make one call and there is a new one at my office the next morning. Try that with Sony. I have a lot of love for Sony, since the early 1980's when I bought my first Walkman to now with 2 Brava TV's, two surround sound systems, and two blue ray players. I hope one day they get on Board with Big Red, but until then I will go with who has never let me down. I hope this makes sense and Thank the group for allowing me to put my 2 cents in.*Respectfully*
, + Fernando Gonzalez It sounds like you have a plan, and that is what is most important. Too many people get caught up the SPEC race, and unless you are an Eagle to odds of seeing the difference between 350PPI, and 410 are pretty darn slim. If you are solely Metro based T Mobile has those areas covered, since you have the Wi-Fi and understand VOIP, you should be good.

I have the MAXX and Love It, the Active On, ''OK Google Now'', ''Call the nearest hardware store'', or ''Call The Office'', a phone that knows when I am driving. Try telling your Samsung anything in sleep mode to Wake Up. LOL. There are Samsung Fan boys, and then their are people who Embrace Technology, understand it and Functionality and have silent gratitude that they did not make a mistake and buy a piece of oversized plastic. I run my MAXX about as hard as anyone Verizon has ever seen. Same thing with the RAZR MAXX HD I had before this phone. I almost got caught up in the Hype of ''The Phablet'', and switched to the Sony Xyperia Z Ultra, the world's thinnest phone, and with a larger display than the Samsung, then an I.T. P pro broke it down for me, he too also has The New Nexus 7, which will forever update to the Latest Version of Android, and between having a phone with a 3500mah battery all the true Functionality of the MOTO X, and then some. I attest that no matter how hard I run my MAXX it will make it through a 16 hour day of non stop work. As it is I have all the Power and Functionality and on the Most Reliable Network, the ability to Edge Up when I please, the quality of a Motorola / Google Phone, that is not a ''Phablet'' but still a Cell Phone. I respect anyone who buys Samsung, but in my mind and heart, I know I made the best possible choice. I can flick my wrist twice and snap pictures in 2 seconds when needed. It takes Samsung close to 5, I can make a call or get directions by talking to my phone when it is in sleep mode without picking it up. Try that with your Samsung
Exactly, You Cannot They can copy a lot of things; however that feature is too advanced for Samsung to knock off. Praise Google for buying Motorola and for having the brightest minds in the business. Somethings are priceless
+ rob horton That is Classic, Samsung Talk. Batteries & Extra Batteries. I have never not made it through a Hard Day of use with my MAXX . 3500mah Internal Power with a Quad Core. It wasn't deemed the longest running, out of the box Phone for two Generations in a row on Accident. The fortunate ones don't have to worry about silly things like changing a battery. Reality Speaks Loudest Google and Motorola are truly so far ahead, it's a pleasure to see Sammy Fan Boys make excuses. Thanks, you made me smile
+ Cory McNutt What little you understand about phones or the discussion the sleep feature is what the MOTO and MAXX automatically do after not using them for several minutes, but they stay on 24/7 listening for your Voice to command it to do something like call, look up something, or give directions. + rob horton I was very clear when I stated longest lasting battery life out the box, even though the phones I mentioned only have internal batteries. So what you are saying is that when Android Nation and Android Authority did their reviews, and when Motorola made their TV Commercial for two Generations of phones in a row, saying, '' Longest Battery Life of any Phone you can buy..'' That all these experts and 3rd party consulting firms are wrong. As we as CNET ? If that were true we would have seen it in Court and heard about it in reviews. Did we? Heck No! '' Just a few fan boys complaining in a discussion. All I ever heard about phones and getting sued was Samsung getting a huge verdict for stealing technology and that was in USA Courts. The counter suit in a Communist County does not count, as that is not Justice. The MOTO X is American made. Finally a phone that works great and is made here, and provides 4,000 American Jobs. Way to go Google! I was in a discussion about a month ago comparing the Note 3 to the Sony Xyperia Z Ultra and one comment got over 100 plusses, in the discussion I was well over 200. The only people that believe you all is? Yourselves Your manufacturer will not comment, as they know they are beat. Fan boys will be Fanboys . You guys have proven only that. The list goes on and on; however every discussion in Every Group I have every been it is the same thing, some really smart unbiased people and some Fan Boys patting each other on the back. Google: Cell Phone with Longest Battery Life? Yeah its the MAXX and before that it was the RAZR MAXX HD. I guess you are also saying Google is wrong? Come On Please let facts not fabrications, or added memory. This was a stock verse stock discussion, we are comparing out the box phones. Not phones that have been modified. Think about it & Look it up
+ Alexander Maxham You are right so each core is devoted to a separate task, and not draining as much battery, as well as allowing them to al operate independently. This was a Pre loaded comment Waiting for someone to take the bait. Thanks
+ Cory McNutt + Alexander Maxham + rob horton Yes I am Happy! And content that what little I need my phone to do it does. I appreciate + Alexander Maxham Statement about how great Android is. At the end of the day it's what you like that counts. I just get caught up in these phone comparisons, they are both good phones, and both considered High End, Rightfully so. Let's please bury the hatchet, and just be glad we have phones we like. The rest is just, ''Recreational Complaints'' Peace
+ Alexander Maxham Forgive for interpreting your post, ''After using the Note 3 for a Few Weeks, the DROID MAXX seems like an I-Phone for heavy users, lol. If that was not a below the belt Jab, with tones of comparing The MAXX to an I-Phone for heavy users, lol. Did not come off as a comparison, then I have what was it? I really don't care. I just wish people backed up what they say. And as they say, ''If people are trying to bring something down it is because they know what they are belittling is far above them or their gadgets.'' Your words will forever be documented. Just as your attempt to dodge stirring the pot with a Snide Comment. One thing is for Sure you have never seen a Motorola User belittle any phone, nor compare their OS to those that most tech groups agree uniformly do not stack up. I am happy to move on, but it would be nice to see you man up, and come clean with your Altruistic motives that got nothing more than a few comments. Hopefully one day you will learn how to Author content that associates you with credibility and not confusion. It's over... Please move on, or man up. Thanks
