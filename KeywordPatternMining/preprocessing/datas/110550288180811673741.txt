GM said awhile back that they intended this would be it's most expensive model. From what I've seen, the car is indeed very nice. Unfortunately, we don't drive enough miles any more to dedicate this kind of cash to a car. I might drive 6,000 miles a year at best. I plan on replacing my 2011 Volt with a 2014 Volt but even that has gotten hard to justify. I would just go with a SparkEV if I could convince my other half.
What do you suppose the average age is of people who find this car to be "Properly Ugly". I am a big fan of classic American cars and find cars like a Fit or Soul or Cube almost anything from Mazda to be more like strange interplanetary microcraft than cars, but I still don't think of them as ugly, just different and perhaps even practical. I think the i3 looks fine and anyway, would not let exterior styling stop me from getting a car if I liked the powertrain and interior. I see the inside a whole lot more than I see the outside.
Might require a cable-lock of some kind, but also need to have a phone app notify you when your car is charged and ACT on it when it tells you so. I think leaving your car plugged in when it's charged is as bad as someone unplugging when it isn't. This is kinda the same situation in a public laundry... your clothes are dry but you leave them there... or an office microwave when your food is hot and someone else wants to heat their lunch. The concept of sharing a limited resource requires all parties to cooperate. The more limited, the more cooperation is needed.
After over two years of driving, my air dam is still fine and doing what it's supposed to do. No recall needed, it is intended to be very close to the ground and flex and scrape as needed. Don't worry about it.
Next time you scrape, smile to yourself and remember that the noise you just heard is part of the reason the engineering marvel you are driving can go up to 100 MPH and still get excellent range running only on electricity.
