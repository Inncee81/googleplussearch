Cali, I know this is a tad off topic, but just curious what kind of car do you drive? You know we have met in person, I was at your last Birthday Party in Addison. I like to size people up by what I see, it is the ex-cop in me. And tell me what is it that you really like about that car. Does it drive really nice, is it smooth, does it handel and corner well, is it really peppy? Or is it the fantastic gas milage you get? Since you are a geek, Tell us does it have some reallyawesome tech in it? + Cali Lewis
