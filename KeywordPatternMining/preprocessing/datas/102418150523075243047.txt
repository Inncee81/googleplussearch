+ Artem Russakovskii if it's not the Sony event and it's not KitKat or Nexus 5 what is it then? :P
That was a terrible video, just showed all the apps I already have, what about the stock Android apps that may have had changes to them such as the Phone etc...
Would love the rest of Android to be pushed into the Play Store.
