The 12-35mm must have been much better than the 35-100mm if it was really good. Hope the 12-40mm is as good as a Four-Thirds HG lens.
My first impression is that Sony's design team has a great sense of humour. The specifications look great, but the bolted-on look of the grip and viewfinder will be off-putting to many.
