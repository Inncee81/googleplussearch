Trying to win tickets on the radio today. Got to game 1, it'd be cool to be at game 5, too.
I've been planning out how I could listen to the bulk of the game by adjusting the schedule. I think I'll get a solid seven innings in!
I think that's crap but I doubt it'll be a significant benefit for them. I predict a Texas loss tonight. They really have a hard time in these high stakes games.
Yeah, I'll be at work during the game but I'll be checking the score every two minutes, rooting for the Rays!
