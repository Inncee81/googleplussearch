You mean the better camera with the better sensor made by Sony that's in the Samsung do you Gordon? ﻿ I got my Z a few weeks ago and funny enough I was a bit disappointed with the low light shots as well, so I decided to test it against my previous gold standard for phone cameras: my iPhone 4S. The results were as follows: the iPhone's flash is stronger than my Xperia, and the noise is a touch higher on the Z as well, but I can clearly see details with the Z that is just dark blobs on the iPhone. The spots where I can match the details on the iPhone to the Xperia, the details are very blurry, with the Xperia being noisier but more detailed. Overall I would say that if you want awesome low light shots, then use a proper camera, but if you have to use a phone then the Xperia rates as one of the better ones. High noise levels or not.
I will post direct comparisons between my iPhone and Xperia, the Xperia has already beaten the iPhone in my eyes.. And I'm not so sure about the Samsung either. When a colleague's Samsung S4 froze up the first time he wanted to show me a game and then the same happened when my brother tried to show me a game, my reservation grew. ﻿ It looks like Samsung may not be worthy to kiss Sony's ass, never mind kicking it.
