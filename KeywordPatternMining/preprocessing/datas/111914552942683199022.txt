Exactly + don harrison i looked at prices for Australia, USA & UK. If #apple even wanted a price point of difference? i think they dropped the ball when you compare #Android versions on the market. I have apple desktops, iPads & iPods. I really can't be bothered paying high prices for another device. The benefit would be that, they could all sync without any drama. My old android isn't that old but seems to be like last century's technology already.
