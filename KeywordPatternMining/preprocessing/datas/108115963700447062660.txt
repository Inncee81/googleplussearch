All you people who think that a non removable battery is a horrible idea are just a bunch of googles puppets. If you can't see that google is pulling an Apple on the crowd and control everything you do that matters, Id have to say that youve bumped your head.
Go ahead +Chris Jackson and assume all you want. Yes I like Samsung products. They make the good tvs. I do not use their cell phones, so alot of what you said is Latin to me. I have an android tablet that is made by Samsung. I purchased it because its one of the only tablets on the market that swipes credit cards that's not an iPad. As a business decision it makes the most sense. Call me a fan based on that if you want but as a daily cell phone user that's never had a Samsung, i think their the only android phone holds any credit. Yeah they make different versions but they're all uniquely different and not just making the different space and capacity levels us as consumers used to do on our own with SD cards and batteries.
Yes sir Mr maxham your right. I rock their tvs as well. So funny!
