Early this year I got a Lenovo Yoga with a second monitor and Windows 8 interface seemed fairly intuitive with the arrangement. touch screen on one side, large screen on the other; unplug and pack to go when on the road. I can see how, If I had a desktop, or an old laptop without touch screen and insisted on using Windows 8, I would get frustrated...
