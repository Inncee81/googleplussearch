Next launcher just felt like a copy of spb shell to me... Bought it while it was half price and I never use it
Nah, spb shell was in the works way before next... And was released first. They are still very close in resemblance, no matter who released which first.
I won't disagree on that... But what always bothered me about Go team is how their apps eventually turn to bloat...
I'm also wondering if the high price and the resemblance to SPB shell is possibly due to them buying code from SPB...
