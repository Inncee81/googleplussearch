The bigger battery doesn't always necessitate the longer life....and the reviews or battery test haven't even been done yet... I bet people will be surprised what rue battery life of this phone is..the company isn't stupid...
True but + Larry Page has stated battery life was extremely important moving forward...and if + Google is launching a smart watch a long side the N5 I'd have to believe they took great care in putting battery life front and center;especially if rumours of the watch being built around Google Now it would be used a lot more than other watches in my opinion....
Yes...as long as its better than the N4, I'll be happy.. OIS might change a bit, as well as kitkat..well see how much of what either said comes to light...
Don't get me wrong, I've loved what rooting has done to my N4, more so with battery life. But I really want a phone that just works out right out of the box... Not entirely sure the N5 will achieve that but, if + Larry Page and + Vic Gundotra held true to their desires moving forward for Android this could be a spectacular device.... We will just have to wait and see ...
