I was addicted to the technology; dad tried to enter the market with a Pong game. The restaurant owner in which it resided burned, so we never made it back into the HUGE FLOW OF MONEY the arcade craze caused. At one point they were putting SO MANY QUARTERS into Galaga, it had to be emptied three times a DAY, and in the morning, it was full-and-overflowing. Crazy times.
