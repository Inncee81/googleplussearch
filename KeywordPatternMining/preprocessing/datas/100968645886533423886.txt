Lame as fuck then !!!!!!what the fuck google come on man 2.3 GHz quad core processor (w) a 5" screen and ur only gonna put a 2300 MAH IN IT. DUNNO ABOUT THAT!!!!!! Unless there must be some new tech in the battery!? Meaning less battery more power. + Herbillest iBun + Zoheb M. I don't know!!!!!! I need my phone to last these days, I use my phone alot and the note 2 last all day for heavy users. My guess is ur gonna use the 4th 2.3 ghz processor to manage power management or some thing for this to work . just don't get why you would put such a small bat in the phone when the same phone from lg g2 comes with a 3100 mah . why!!!!!!????????????

I'm tired of walking around with chargers man daaaaaaam!!!! Don't wanna sell out but battery is important to me and I know google know this and the developers also so, this is crap if that is all the juice they gonna put in the battery . DAAAM unless there is some way google has found to manage battery performance like use the 4th quad core 2.3 GHz to manage power
