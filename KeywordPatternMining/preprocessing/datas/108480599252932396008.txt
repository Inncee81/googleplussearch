We arrived in Yangshuo China last night and got a bunch of shooting done so far.

So far so good! Here is a Nexus 10 / Snapseed edit from Hong Kong that I took a few days ago. Cheers from China!

Oxararfoss waterfall, Iceland Oxararfoss waterfall is located in a canyon like area at the junction of two large continental tectonic plates in Thingvellir National Park. The waterfall flows from the edge of the American tectonic plate. Across the rift is the Eurasian tectonic plate, so this picture was actually taken between two continents! #iceland #photography #landscapephotography #waterfall #oxararfoss

I'm probably the 100th person to share this on G+, but man this is just some truly amazing technology! Found this over on John Nack's blog (thanks Karl-Franz), and I'm watching it and just sitting here shaking my head in disbelief -- wow!!!! How do people think up this stuff? Very cool! Opens lots of new doors for creatives and product development.
Somewhere at an epic waterfall in Western Iceland It was midnight that night in Iceland and it was raining. Despite this, when you are on the site of a majestic waterfall, one takes his camera and attempt to capture the scene The interactive panorama is here: #iceland #photography #panoramaphotography #photoextractplus
+ Carla McMahon it's the fall we were at on june 9 where it rained at midnight. We stayed there à couple of hours. You remember?
+ Carla McMahon , now I understand that the iPhone picture misled you. I was wondering if you had a nice dinner with too much wine! Hehe Lol
lóndrangar Lóndrangar are a pair of single sharp and steep cliffs, or volcanic plugs of basalt, that have been hewn out from softer surrounding rock by erosion. At 75 m and 61 m respectively, they are a singular sight, rising above and outside the ocean front on the southern coast of Snæfellsnes peninsula. History has it so that the taller of the cliffs was ascended in 1735, while the smaller one was left alone longer and not climbed until 1938, or so the story goes
After The Flight. I do love me some photography and will go out of my way to find what I need to see. From there, I will share what I find with you. This is my newly built setup for taking shots from above. Bear in mind there are rules in place when flying UAV's. Today I will be assisting teaching a class put on by + Russell Preston Brown here at Photoshop World Vegas 2013. The class sold out very quick. If you have any questions about this feel free to ask me as I will be here all week. Kudos to + Colin Guinn and all of DJI for making such a great product, and to + centuryhelicopters for taking care of all my silly questions. [This one's setup to hold the + Sony NEX-7 and I can chose to shoot video or do still captures remotely]
