I'm on my work pc so I have to resend this so I can get into the link later. I want a cool wireless one for my office. I have the Qi pad in my home office
+ Tobin Rysenga I found a Qi charging pad and receiver for my S IV for $40 on eBay. I like the idea of the one that stands up for my desk at work
Would be better if the wood panels were on the outside #griswald
I still can't find those by me!
