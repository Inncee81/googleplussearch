I've got my N7, wife has her N10. It's really a matter of style, and how you will want to use it. For example, I love sitting at the kitchen table holding the tablet in one hand and drinking coffee with the other. My wife finds it much too small, and her favorite style is curled in a comfortable padded chair with the N10 on a pillow. We both use them mostly to consume media (newspapers, magazines, blogs, etc.). Think about how you'll likely be most comfortable using it and go from there.
