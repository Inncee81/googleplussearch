+ Ananda Sim I totally agree with what you just said, I run into that noise issue at 12 mega pixel right now tho it has a gotten much better as you say. Its funny, our culture treats analog as primitive but film is actually the resolution of the molecules in the emulsion.

I think the body language of cell phone use is an interesting topic in its own right, these gestures and problems, tripping and falling rates have gone way up, are new in terms of the known history of civilization. Great photo
I learn more about cameras from your posts than any place else I can think of, thank you
+ Ananda Sim Thanks for the quote!
