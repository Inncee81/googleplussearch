Waiting patiently on the Z1 price and release date for + T-Mobile . It'd be nice if we got the same smart watch 2 pre-order bonus as EU.
+ LeVo DS I didn't see any mention of that feature, I believe it is exclusive to the Z Ultra.
My wife takes her phone to the pool all the time... We also go to theme parks with water rides etc and we got kids, spills are a normal occurance. I also dropped my phone in the snow last winter and flipped out lol.

The 360 pad isn't comfortable to me for hour sessions... It being smaller is a plus for me and it looks fine to me from the pics. The PS3 pad is my favorite due to familiarity and also doesn't crap my hands. I can play hour long sessions no problem, but the build and size makes it feel like a toy and not premium. Enlarging it and making it with premium materials make it near perfect, especially with the new triggers. Both pads improved their flaws which is just better for us gamers.
My buddy has a WiiU and I have still yet to play it, not even held the controller.
If they did a Link to the Past, Orcarina of Time and a Super Metroid remake, I'd buy in a heartbeat. The new Mario 3D World looks great too.
