Full frame mirrorless cameras are very compelling no matter who makes it, but the charm of m43 is as much in its lenses as its camera bodies. A 90mm 1.8 lens for the Sony FF will be HUGE, but for m43 it is absolutely tiny. Being able to fit your entire kit into a small bag is a huge advantage of m43, that a FF can never take away. That said, I hope to buy a future FF mirrorless camera from someone. Probably not going to be this one.
