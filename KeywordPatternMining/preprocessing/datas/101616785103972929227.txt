Maybe they won't be the "holy grail" of mirrorless cameras, but at least a very shiny one. The price and the specs definitely got me. The package seems very delivering! I'm only waiting till + Trey Ratcliff will carry them both around, the A7r as main and the A7 as it's backup cam as he does right now with the NEX 7 and NEX 6 :P Say "Hello" Trey
+ Theo Brookes Sony seems to be fair(er) when it comes to the pricing of the new cams. I can understand your concerns as I live in Germany and international companies often just replace the "$" character with "€". (e.g. Sonys PS4 which is 399$ in the US and 399€ in GER). But here, the Alpha A7 is listed for 1500€ (1700$) and the A7r will be 2100€ (2300$). Unfortunately I can't tell you when it comes to the UK pricing. -> Thx + Richard Sibley !
