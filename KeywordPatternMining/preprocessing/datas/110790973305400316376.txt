Off the top of my head: 1. better pocketability. As we all know we are curved not flat, so a slight curve would improve both portability of larger devices both in pants and jacket pockets. 2. A curved surface also cuts down a lot on reflections. 3. It would also be less susceptible to scratches (the curve would prevent the whole screen coming in contact with a surface)
