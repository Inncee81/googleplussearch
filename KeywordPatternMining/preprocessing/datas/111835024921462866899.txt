Ah so thats why you are selling your gear! ;)
Ah nice timing then! Would have been awkward had you just got an NEX7 and this dropped a few days later!
The established camera companies need to get into this game before they are left behind. A big Nikon mirrorless camera that you can use your existing lenses on would be killer! ..they need to stop messing around with little point and shoots.
While we're on, I mentioned this to Leigh... its weird how the US is raving about Sony but Europe, UK, Oz, Far East etc are raving about the Fuji system. Never hear much from the US on Fujis...
Ahem... Who gave you all your great ideas, helped name the site etc etc - wheres MY f***ing t-shirt?!!! ;)
