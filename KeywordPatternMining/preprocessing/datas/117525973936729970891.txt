Glad to hear you're liking it Gino! I've got a Leash and Cuff and am now a solid fan of + Peak Design . I came this close to backing the Capture during the Kickstarter campaign. Wound up not (had to get some stuff for those pesky college courses instead, ya know), but I still really want one. Or try one for a bit, at the very least. I wasn't sure how much I'd really use it, but I'm in an environmental portraits class right now and there's been about a half dozen times that I've been on location juggling a bunch of gear. And almost every time all I can think is I should've just bought that damn clip! Haha.
