I've been following news on the 4C for what feels like years. The low curb weight is extremely enticing and I was regularly daydreaming about owning one. That is, until I found out there would not be a manual transmission version. :-/
hey, I'm from the midwest. Its in my nature to be living in the past! just wait until you see what I'm daily driving now. + Ãšlfar Erlingsson already spotted me in Mountain View and learned my dirty secret.
+ John Reck I promise I was shopping for vettes when I found it for sale!
