Oh my lord....what a fantastic photo, I've been toying with either getting the 7-14 or replacing my GX1 with the GX7. .decisions decisions!
What a great review.... Thanks for the work, so detailed... A labour of love!
Have you had any second thoughts on the EVF? I loved the review but Tbh your comments on it kinda put me off... I want to love it but need to look for myself.
