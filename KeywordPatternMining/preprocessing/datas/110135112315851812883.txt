It's too bad that most scientists overlook the fact that their measuring devices of testing how old something is not reliable past at most twenty thousand years. Even to be scientifically accurate, it has to be within the confines as verified by human history and even then there have been many cases where human history has disproven the accuracies of these measuring devices. To me, that is the blind using blind devices in leading the blind.
