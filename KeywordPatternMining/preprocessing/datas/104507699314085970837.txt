300 seconds from a fairly small sensor... I'm impressed actually with the noise level.
How's the balance while sitting one handed? Small bodies with big lenses often have poor balance, thus requiring two handed shooting, in which case the body size matters less.
4x bigger or 4x as big? There's a difference. Thanks for your excellent work!
Hold the curry on mine please.
Certainly an impressive processor to be able to apply such a processor intensive filter to HD video.
I tried taking the survey but the layout of the questions just didn't make any sense. Sorry but IMO, you'll need to revamp the survey with a logical format if you plan to graduate.
I was hoping this review would come soon from you + Gordon Laing . My wife has had the S series since the S90. Her S90 broke and I got her the S95. It got stolen so I got her the S100. She disliked the many problems with it so we sold it and got the S110. She loves it, especially the built in Wi-Fi but she wishes it was more responsive for the action shots of the kids, and she's jealous of the responsiveness of my Sony RX100M2. Do you think we should sell her S110 for the S120? Is it significantly more responsive with faster AF and less shutter lag? Thanks again.
+ Gordon Laing Very cool! I'm looking forward to seeing the head to head against my awesome RX100M2, which by the way, I'm currently having a pretty deep cam-mance with. Sustained bursts at near 10fps is impressive indeed. I assume that's in jpg only and has a buffer count for RAW+jpg, which is what we shoot in for all our cameras. If the S120 responds faster than my RX100M2 though, I'll be both impressed and pissed at the same time, and I'll have to get it for the wife too of course. Thanks again.
+ Gordon Laing The videos look impressive but there was some weird jittering in some bits of the first one where you walk through the cafe. :-/
As good as the G series has become, I just can't call it an enthusiast compact until it starts at 24mm.
I was hoping Canon would include a 24mm focal length in the zoom lens. Oh well. Maybe the G17 will bring some wide love.
IMO, stay away from the Tiffen Dfx. I tried it and it's terrible. A huge waste of $.
Pretty cool but $90 for a few ounces of plastic seems about $70 too high.
