Its such a shame that + HTC (and Samsung et al) think there is value in hiring programmers to drastically change vanilla Android in their attempt to lock in customers to their brand. We value the mobile phone manufacturers because of their differentiated hardware . Moto X has the "always listening" voice processor, HTC has front facing speakers, Oppo has the rotating front/back camera... Samsung has.... has... has... well not much.
