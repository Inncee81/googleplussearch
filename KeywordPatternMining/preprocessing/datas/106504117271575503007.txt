$600?! My Transformer Infinity last year cost me $500, plus $100 for the dock (I have the Prime dock, it's the same damn thing). Any mention on if the dock is backwards compatible? Anyone interested in buying last year's model from me?
The next set of tablets fixed that just fine, + Patrick Ryan . The issue with the Infinity and 300 was the Tegra 3 chipset, which had issues that Nvidia just didn't care to resolve before sending it out for manufacturers. I'm not sure about the Tegra 4, but I'm sure they fixed that because those issues haven't popped up on devices like the Shield. I blame Nvidia for the issues, as Asus has tried and tried to fix them but couldn't figure out how to do so. I do place blame on Asus for putting out the tablet with obvious issues though...they should've scrapped the tablets and done a different chipset.
I have 4.2 on my TF700, not 4.3 yet. And if what you're saying is true, then the sluggishness should be gone on my tablet as well when Asus puts out the 4.3 update...should be coming fairly quickly since they've gotten the updates out in decent time in the past. The Tegra 3 is a different chipset than used in the TF201. The aluminum body was the issue with that and any other tablet, including the iPad, when it came to reception. At least Asus tried to fix it with an attachment, but it's still not the best thing to do to your customers. But they could've just said screw you to the customers and not done anything about it. I really want to see how this works out with the TF701, as there's been some improvements and the Tegra 4 chipset seems more promising. I really want to know the information in this article is correct though...I've heard they're selling it for $500 with the dock, here it says $600 without it.
