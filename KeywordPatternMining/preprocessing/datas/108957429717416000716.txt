As usual with such things it isn't backed up with a lens portfolio to do it justice.
That is where I came up with the conclusion, no UWA lens, no fast tele, no macro. It might be lighter, but that is the only advantage over my 5Dmk3.
If it were half the cost of a full frame DSLR I would cut it some slack, but as it is the same very hefty cost, the total ecosystem has to be taken into account for its target market which has to be professionals.
I thought it was about $2500 which is in 6d territory. Regarding the lenses, I can't talk for Canon as I have only been into them for 4 years. The Sony NEX line still has a disappointing array of lenses, which has stopped my interest in them. I would love a smaller lighter camera if it has the IQ and lenses I need, but that day hasn't come.
I think the RX10 is interesting as it has a good size sensor for a bridge and a nice f/2.8 lens. Would make a nice travel camera.
