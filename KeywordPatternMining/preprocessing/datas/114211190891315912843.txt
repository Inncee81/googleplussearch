The XBox was a decent piece of machinery, I would have never thought Microsoft to deliver such. But still, the PS3 was in many ways better. I never owned a gaming console in my 32 years of life, but I might actually make the move - finally.
+ Mark Gillespie , I haven't heard of the 60% failure rate. But even considering that, Windows 95, XP, Vista and 7 all must have got a failure rate at around 100%. Even the server editions were flawed. The amount of times I had to "fix" Windows machines (not fix but the OS needed re-installation) is massive. I seriously dislike Microsoft, but have to hand it to them: SQL Server (since 2005), Word, Excel and PowerPoint are good products. And yes, I also count the XBox to this.
