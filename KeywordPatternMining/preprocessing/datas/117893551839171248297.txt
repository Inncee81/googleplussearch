I would agree with this is this were a big product from one of the other manufacturers. Say Samsung or HTC. This however is a Nexus and if we're being honest here the Nexus really isn't there to compete with iPhones so I don't see how doing something like this would be disruptive to Apple.
I'm not sure that the smartphone world should make a step like this without first trying to solve power issues. Battery technology is horribly in need of an upgrade and would have more immediate benefits in not just mobile tech but probably on a broader scale as well.
