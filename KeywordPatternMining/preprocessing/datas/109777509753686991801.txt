Google has a different business model to Facebook and Twitter, you can't measure its success by referrals, how ridiculous!
Wtf is up with that camera poking out the back?? I take damn good care of my hardware, but the camera bump was the first thing to get dented on my HTC One X. I don't like cases on phones, so I'll pass.
You're right, they'll change it for retail. #fingerscrossed
It's like something Nokia might have tried ten years ago. BTW, what's the difference between this and the GNex's similarly concave screen?
I think us phone nerds overestimate the size of the company. It was always a small fry - it only dominated the WinMo scene because there were so few decent manufacturers at the time. They never scaled very well when android truly took off, and remained a relatively small company, whilst tech behemoths like Sammy and LG vomited plastic phones all over the market. When faced with the make or break decision of following a Samsung 'ten devices per quarter' strategy, or the Apple single device approach, they halfheartedly went with the Apple model and it simply hasn't paid off. The only thing I can see them doing is reengaging with the dev community to build back some of the goodwill they have lost. Let's face it, the dev community is only there because of HTC. I remember the old XDA introduction on the front page, about HTC being a mysterious eastern manufacturer nobody had heard of, who provided little instruction on good phones, so the devs banded together to bring them to life. I miss that mysterious company.
