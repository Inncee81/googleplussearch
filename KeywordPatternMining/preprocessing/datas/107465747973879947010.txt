Look to California to see where this leads. We pay taxes on gas for roads that go unpaved. The funds go to the general fund. We pay for education (min of 43% of budget) and have school districts that only have 50% of students graduate. As for the police and firefighters sorry but this is never paid for by the previous generation (the rest of us.) and is a part of self interest so let's not forget that. Actually, if you look at the pensions, the following generation will pay for it. Then you have the people that actually pay taxes (36%) and then look at the percentage of overall taxes those business owners pay. How about we all pay taxes? Companies, religious organizations, employees, non-profits no matter how much you make. 10% will that do it? I bet there is a bigger argument every time the rate is raised.
So 2 more points 1) Don't forget WE are not paying for it. Foreign investors are (about 30%). 2) What about those you do not educate? We paid for their education but they can't get a job. Who is paying for them? Wouldn't you rather we get them a job? (Let me answer that, no no you would not.)
