Buy, buy, buy (not the NSync song)
I know right? I have a web page on the devices section the Google Play store just in case ... Don't think they'll be rolling out with the 32GB model at launch (whenever that is) .
This is one of the 3 phones I was interested in getting. Not does it / will it have any special features related to the PS4?
Excellent stuff. I was hoping they would do smart and add features like that. Still haven't decided on which device I am going to get, but this is on my top 3 for sure.
Actually that is what I'm waiting for. I want to see what it's going to bring to the table. Personally, I would love to see a microSD slot, but I doubt that is going to happen.
That was the other phone on my radar. The size throws me off a bit, but I do like the features.
