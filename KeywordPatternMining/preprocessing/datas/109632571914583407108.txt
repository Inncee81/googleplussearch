Agreed with +Cali Lewis Heck most of the reason people talk about stuff in general on the net is when they're complaining. For example if your email client is working fine you usually have no reason to even mention it, but if it's not working you're more likely to complain about it online.
+ Lasse Huhtala You get something better, a full screen. Faster access to your stuff than digging through menus. Of course you can use WinKey+X for some things if you really like working slow.
+ David Hall Right, 8 / 8.1 is better with a mouse than earlier versions were.
+ Johnny R It's more comfortable to hold and fits in your pocket better. Not to mention the rocking function of the G Round where it pops up info when you rock it towards you.
+ shane blyth They were also ridiculously thick and heavy.
+ Ben Garman To go along with the Kitten Mittons.
I've been there! Twice!
