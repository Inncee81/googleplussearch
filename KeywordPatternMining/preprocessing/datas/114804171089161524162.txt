Not sure what this has to do with SSL being broken?
+ Max Kotchouro Well that's why I asked. I still don't see how that's SSL being broken. Secret keys are called that for a reason. Being forced to hand them to the authorities is a problem with overreaching government more than the technology. Are SSH host keys broken as well? They don't even have CA signatures. I'm not aware of any strong crypto that is immune to MITM if your keys (and DNS) get out of your possession.
If I could "hack" with federal court orders, I'd be pretty unstoppable too. That still doesn't make this a technology problem. Point to which strong crypto method isn't vulnerable to this attack? And if we can't trust the CAs, how is any connection to be trusted? We trust the root servers for DNS (yes, I know there are problems there too), but if this system is so bad, how is it to be fixed? Short of pre-shared keys, that is , which is how we solve the SSH problem.
I trust SSL to work the way it was designed the same way I trust my door locks to stay locked until someone comes along with the keys. (Yes, I know this isn't a perfect analogy as a lock can be brute forced, but try not to over think it) The government having the power to coerce or steal someone's private keys does not make the technology weak.
He should have put a passphrase on the keys. Hasn't it been established that passwords are protected under the Fourth and Fifth?
