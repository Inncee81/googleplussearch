I'm loving my chromecast, and so is Jack. He now knows to ask me for Netflix or YouTube to watch his favourite things now. We almost never bother with regular tv. I hooked out up so that the tv turns on and switches sources immediately when you hit the cast button so that my wife couldn't complain about it not being easy to use.
Neither does shoppers drug mart, or Longo's.
Everyone has the Halloween versions atm.
