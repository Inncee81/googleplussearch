Not used the Z1, but the megapixels should help in cropping the photo. SnapSeed is great for tuning the photos... Most things look better with a little structure + sharpening (details option). It also has a pretty good auto option. If you're touching up (ooo err) on a computer give the Google+ Photos a go. It's powered by Nik Software like Snapseed and is very good.
