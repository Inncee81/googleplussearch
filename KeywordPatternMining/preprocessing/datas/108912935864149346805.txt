Looks like an awesome little camera, I'm really a fan of the new takes on the rangefinder-type fixed lens cameras like the RX-1 and X100S. There really is so much exciting stuff happening in the mirrorless world (both fixed and removable lens) while there is nothing really "new" in the DSLR world, as you guys mentioned. I currently have an OM-D E-M5 and absolutely love it, it will be very interesting to see where things are when it comes time to replace it in a couple years time.
