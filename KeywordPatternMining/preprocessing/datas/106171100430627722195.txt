I love the note 3.
I don't mind touchwiz too much, maybe because I've only owned Samsung phones, besides the g2x lol. I agree it's ugly as all hell, but I utilize a lot of the features it brings to the table, and the battery gives me more than I really need.
Yea I agree 100% it's not as good as the note 2 (battery wise) I can't wait for some jedi love so I can get the 2 or 3 days of use I was so accustomed to on the note 2.
