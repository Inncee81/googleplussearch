Any chance of the Z1 f coming to the US?
+Fernando Gonzalez, thanks but I was actually asking about the mini version of the Z1, the Z1 f, which has essentially the same internals except a 4.3 inch screen and is much smaller. It has been announced as a Japan exclusive for now. I would love the opportunity to buy it as the Z1 is a bit too large for my tastes.
