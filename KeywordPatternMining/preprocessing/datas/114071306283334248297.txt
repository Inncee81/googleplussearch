I like that HTC doesn't use the term phablet (at least officially) but instead calls it a smartphone tablet. It's great really. Despite some of it's deficiencies. I just hope it comes out in Stealth Black as well.
+ Jason Wynn the Ones have no reception problems.
+ Rusty Greer because the scanner is locater right where your index finger naturally sits when holding the phone.
Makes Sense (pun intended) why HTC never put widgets in the app drawer in the first place
