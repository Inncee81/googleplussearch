Fantastic! Now make more of those games that deliver cross platform play devs!
Completely agree + Richard Dixon . The amount of push Nintendo is making for indie devs to join in might be something that will fully be acknowledged soon. I hope this helps many of them realize how cool the platform is.
PSN and XBL are closed networks no? Only consoles I've heard that do cross platform play is Vita with Monster Hunter... I could be wrong tho.
Well there goes that theory + Richard Dixon haha.
