Use this to help choose your next rental: What your camera captures at every lens’ focal length
Behind the Shot: I found a good vantage point in a higher cavern above the rim pool, placed my camera on a tripod, used a shutter cable (with lens on bulb setting), used 4 light sources (LEDs, including one under the kayak in a plastic lock box and Steve's headtorch) and had the main backlight move around until the reflection appeared on the surface of the pool. The shot wouldn't have worked if there was any breeze (and there usually is in this cave) and I was lucky to have my friend Steve paddling as both he and the kayak were able to remain absolutely stationary for the full 49 seconds exposure.
