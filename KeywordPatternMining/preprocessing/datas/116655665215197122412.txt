I think I am washing my hair that day! Thanks.
Good challenge + Lexy Savvides & looks successful. I will still find it difficult to leave the DSLR at home though. + Michael Sutton will like these!
I used my Samsung Galaxy Camera for a few shots & it did quite well. Used in Manual mode, pushed the ISO to 1600, aperture to the widest, shutter speed of about 1/2 second on a Gorilla Pod. Was surprised how good some of them worked of the Opera House. There were thousands of people using mobile phones & from what I could see on the back of them some of the images were good. I guess we are getting to the stage that the compact point & shoot is on its way out now.
Sony manufacture sensors for Nikon + Michael Sutton so I hope they arent getting out! Grande Fromage this one........
Maybe we could run a light painting workshop in space + Michael Sutton ??
Can you block this feed now?
I have seen this before & can imagine + Stephen Godfrey doing this. For me I get far too much dust in without doing this. Maybe on the old D70s.......... I think + Michael Sutton refers to this as free-balling too!
Thanks + Lexy Savvides . Will have to start bracketing more now I know some of + Elia Locardi tricks!
