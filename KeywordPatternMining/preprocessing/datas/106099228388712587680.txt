The biggest moron is in the w.h.
Thats an asinine comparison, and just because something is law doesn't mean it's good or right. That's the argument. This bullshit about it being settled law... If they can amendments to the constitution, a crap law is fair game.
And was not approved by dems and reps btw... It was forced through congress, and barely passed... By votes from elected officials of dubious elections.
So are the dems
