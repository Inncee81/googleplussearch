OMG, please don't pass around this socialist garbage, especially from a known liar. The rich people are basically already bearing the majority of the tax burden. Before passing around this type of crap, how about addressing the 6th generation welfare families and the crap that goes on in Chicago, Detroit, LA and NYC.
