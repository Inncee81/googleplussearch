I agree about the closings but that's part of their life/faith. They give more than enough notice on their site so it doesn't come as a surprise. Just plan ahead. The only thing that gets me is that when something is on back order and comes in that first day of the closing for a week, well, you have to wait an extra week like I am for a lens right now. They should implement a "drop shipment" from the manufacturer in this case. I've been doing business with them for over 22 years and have never had a problem. In fact, they just got better with regards to customer service and any returns. Their prices are reasonable and fair.
