I think I started with a 110 camera from Dixons; a Prinzmatic I think. Then I went 35mm with an old Agfa Silette, I recall countless rolls of CT18 and sometimes the faster CT21 transparency films, plus Kodachrome too. And then a Praktica MTL3 too with a couple of lenses. I worked out the I was not destined to repair lenses when I took the 28mm apart and it never worked again. Next up was a Yashica FX103 Program and automatic TTL flash metering Then in the late 80's the EOS 650 became my first Canon, and was replaced by the 650... And then I started buying lenses including the EF85mm f/1.8 USM I still have today. Eye control and an interest in Motorsport meant the 600 became an EOS 5. A 300mm f/4L USM was a first taste of Canon L glass. I was shooting 150 rolls of film a year as an advanced amateur.... Then I went to a camera company in late 1995, and I was in a team launching a new range of cameras called PowerShot... 15 years later I left to go freelance having used pretty much every Canon digital EOS, IXUS and PowerShot. Today I own the EOS 5D Mark3... 5 must be my lucky number. Somewhere between 1995, maybe as late as 2000 I bumped in to a journalist called Gordon at a launch event. Our paths have crossed several times since.
