"I can already tell this phone is fast" , just turned it on for the first time. Admires build quality then puts a case on it. Kinda funny. Sure its a great phone: it just has a small battery, runs ios7 , and has a small screen. At least this year apple made some real improvements to their phone compared to the 4s. Call me a hater but I'm just trying to be realistic.
+ christopher rizzo have you owned the G2 or nexus 4 before? What makes them horrible?
+ christopher rizzo it only cost $300, so you can't get everything, but I see where you're coming from
+christopher rizzo to each his own. Price does matter to some, which is why people buy the nexus 4 over other play phones like the GS4. I do agree that the hardware designs of the nexus 4 were a bit poor. It looks good but I need a case for it. Iphone 5c cost >$500 and is made of plastic. Tablets are much cheaper than phones. In the future I wish a company like nokia could offer phones software free, and we could download our own. That would be the best of both worlds.
