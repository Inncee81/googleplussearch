Looks slimmer than the N4 - the N4 had five icons in each row. The thin bezels are nice, looks like it will be a great phone. This video didn't show the tap and pay section and OK Google Now - but as you said it looks like the old version of 4.4. And what was that green home icon in the app drawer? The video is either choppy, or the software didn't look optimized.
I really hope it gets released in the Play Store. Better yet - how great would it be if 4.4 KitKat was packaged as a "launcher" in the play store? Like a Trojan Horse invading....itself. After all this is supposed to be the release "for everyone". mind blown
Holy Crap that happened to me too last week! I was in my car listening over Bluetooth and it did the same thing!!!! Wow.
