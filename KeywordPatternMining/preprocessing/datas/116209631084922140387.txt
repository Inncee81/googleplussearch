+ Mathieu Gasquet the "no regrets" caught my interest. I will be watching to see how you're feeling 2 months into this. I am on the fence. I own a D80 and an LX5. The LX5 is my daily shooter and I pull out the D80 for more serious times. I've considered the GX7 to replace both, and be my sole camera. But, I've also leaned toward going D7100 and keeping the LX5. Question ... Are you using any Nikkor glass adapted to the GX7?
