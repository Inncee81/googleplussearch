It is surperising and happy to know that such a great photographer like you also started with Paktica. Though in my childhood I started with my father's Agfa box canera, but had to give up as it was stolen. After getting my job in 1964, I bought a second hand Praktica with a Tessar lens in 1966. Since than I worked with it extensively till1990 when it went out of order and could not be repaired. After a gap of 22 years without a camera, I bought a new Nikon D7000 with two zoom lens, at the age of 67.But my passion with my Praktica with which I took more than 40000 snaps and which tought me all the thing in photography including darkroom technology. I simply love it and has kept it nicely for my future generation to see.
