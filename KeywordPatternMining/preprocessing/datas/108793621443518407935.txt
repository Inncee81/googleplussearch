I'm not sure I'm the best person to advise you to be honest. In my experience, the more data you have to work with, the better job you can do with post-photo editors. For this reason, I've had some great results from the s4 and the z1. I always struggled to get much from the htc one, but then I found it took pretty good snaps that needed little editing. On my z1 I have the built-in editor, and also an app that came with it called pixlr express. I find the latter a bit too overkill. Sorry I couldn't be more help. Maybe + Simon Jones will offer more help on the z1, and + Tony Owen help on snapping tips.
I stopped paying extra for next day from Amazon. Didn't seem to make a blind bit of difference. What case you going for? I have the roxfit folio and the krussel blue. Would like the krussel flip in camel colour.
I just returned on of those. I found that when you pressed the wake/power button, it also pressed the vol+ button.
I hope you have better luck. Case was actually pretty nice. Just that each time I went to wake it, it pressed vol+ instead/as well as power. That's fine if you're not on vibrate or silent. If you are, it deactivates your profile.
Glad to hear it. I can't fault mine
I sold my Nexus 7 to + Tim Morley as I didn't use it. I have an iPad for that kind of usage. As for being a Sony family, I think Tim is impressed with his wife's mid-range Sony phone too. Maybe he'll stump up for a Z1?
Yeah. I would probably be better with the mini version if it had the 3000mah battery. Love it though. Can see me keeping it quite a long time (for me)
Maybe. It seems very stable and reliable. No reboots, no freezes, all fairly snappy. I can see no reason to change, since I don't hold a lot of importance in where Google are taking the "always listening" features.
Fantastic. As good as my Note 2. I play quite a bit if ingress too - which canes the battery.
Well done Chris. I just got a coupe of magnetic docks today. I want to avoid using the port flaps as much as I can.
Battery is just brilliant for such a svelte device. One less thing to think about....
Also + Chris Spackman I missed the screen protector in the box. + Simon Jones told me it was there - and it's really pretty good. I tend to just remove phones from the box and leave everything untouched.
Got mine through Amazon. Mine are not genuine. About 20 quid each. You can also get adapters on ebay for your charger. I assume they are a similar thing to the end of an magsafe apple cable.
I got one on Saturday. Really like it so far. It feels very like the htc one from a ui standpoint. Battery is brilliant, screen has been 100% for me. Lovely and fast. I am reserving judgement on the camera just now. Not had chance to test.
Had the s4. Nice phone, but I much prefer the z1. No lag for starters!
Much better battery. Snapdragon is next gen (next to s4) I was tempted by the note 3, but after the s4 it doesn't seem worth it.
It's a big s4. The note 2 was a big s3. Note 2 is one of my favourite devices of all time.
It's on xda. Simon and myself are both on latest versions although my device was bought from carphone warehouse so it's unbranded anyway.
Not yet. School run to do, chickens to let out, dogs to walk, accountant to see - THEN work.

What are you doing about the flimsy port covers that fall off?

hmm. Always welcome I guess, but I'm not having any issues to be honest. Would prefer more depth of sound through headphones...that's it.

I'm quite impressed with my z1. Just waiting for casemate tough and a couple of magnetic charging docks.
I've yet to see a decent camera on a Nexus device. That's a biggie for me.
My z1 is growing on me. Not much to grumble about.
Although mother-in-law was enjoying 2 bars of h+ today while I had nada. She has a Note 2 - they would manage a bar of signal in the middle of the Atlantic.
