Booking.com ad came on with two overly excited girls... it was a good lead in until they mentioned the hotel. That looks like a lot of fun
yeah, and it looks like it took some of the best from Mario Galaxy (in terms of level design) and gave it the speed we love. Pretty good looking so far. and the Booking.com ad was what came on when i followed the link. that's why i mentioned it. i thought it was a creative intro until i saw "ad" in the corner
