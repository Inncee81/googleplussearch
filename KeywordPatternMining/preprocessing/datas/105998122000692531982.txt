Not many people are going to pay $75K for a very small car that competes with the larger, more prestigious, more technically sophisticated Tesla S. I love my Volt, and I hope to have it for many years, but it was ~30K after incentives -- and I bought it for HOV stickers more than anything. $75K is serious money for a very small car with very limited electric range. It is upgraded from the Volt in terms of UX, and downgraded in the sense that the interior comes covered in dead animal skins whether you think that's a good thing or not. I just can't imagine many people cross-shopping ELR and Model S and choosing the former.
