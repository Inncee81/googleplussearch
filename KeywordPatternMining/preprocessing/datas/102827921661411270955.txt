The camera software takes the 20 MP image and uses downsampling to essentially "discard" what it considers to be undesirable or unnecessary pixels, to try and produce a better 8mp image than if you were to have only 8mp to begin with.
+ Ilya Rudenko , tricky question - depends which scenario you need, obviously high detail or enlargements will favour higher resolution/megapixels, and many other scenarios depend on software processing etc. However as a broad generalisation, you would give the Xperia Z1 the benefit in most situations (especially low light) due to the larger sensor size and faster (larger f2.0) lens.
