Yup, great points. Ones I try to bring up in my survival boards. Look, I know how to make a friction fire, how to make fire with flint and steel, how to make and use char cloth, how to make fire with a fresnel lens, etc... Do you know what I pack for firestarting gear? A lighter. Actually three lighters and a small container of waterproof matches with a striker. Why? Because lighters are cheap, small, light, and reliable. Even if one breaks or runs out of fluid I have two left for less weight than a flint and steel kit. Also, if I need a fire I want it right away and done easily, I don't want to have to struggle for it. A lighter does that for me (one is always one of the pressurized torch style). Traditional firemaking tools don't. In the worst case scenario I still have multiple steel implements and a magnesium bar with ferrocerium rod on it but I don't intend to use that as my primary fire making tool unless it's for practice or for fun.
