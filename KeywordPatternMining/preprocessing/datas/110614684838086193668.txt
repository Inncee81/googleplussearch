People love to hate touchwiz. I don't mind it so much but I get it. I always end up on an aosp ROM anyways -- with the generally awesome hardware and displays that come with Sammy products it's still worth it. I'd have a problem with losing the Note 3 features that come with touchwiz though, those features are kind of the point in getting a Note.
