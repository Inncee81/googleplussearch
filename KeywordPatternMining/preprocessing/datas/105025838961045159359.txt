+ Alexander Maxham sorry you had a negative Verizon experience. I can share this: they are a good employer.
Ez fix is grabbing a couple extra batteries. Nothing compares to instantly being back to 100% and totally staying off a cord or charging pad.
+ Bill Hubbell : the Maxx was my daily driver for three weeks and I am still a fan but the camera, display, expandable memory, and gaming capabilities of the Note 3 destroy it!!!! And I will put this out there too - the LG G2 is a better buy than the Maxx. The battery life on it is amazing
+ Bill Hubbell : I can kill the Maxx battery via a few hours of riptide and tethering.
I hear you + Cory McNutt . Many of the current offerings have made huge improvements compared to the last generation. I have no complaints regarding the Note 3, but I do love my extra batteries and I do employ them. I like to fall asleep reading via the Kindle app with my precious in hand and untethered
+ Bill Hubbell : I am glad you have found a phone that you enjoy. Cheers.
