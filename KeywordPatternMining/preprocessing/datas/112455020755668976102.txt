Hey Trey, Great article and review of the Sony mirror less system. I recently grabbed a Fuji x100s and am experimenting and so far loving the mirror less world. So quick question for you, being a fan of your work and also a long time burner I know that you attend Burning Man each year, what will be your strategy to photograph on the playa with all the playa dust? Do you think the sealing of the the Sony System will hold up? I am thinking about the same stuff for me this up coming year. Hope you had a great burn talk to you soon.
