I don't have a touch screen and use win8 fine. Initially when Win8 was released I wasn't a fan at all. After a week I started getting use to it and now I love it. It's fast, stable and just works. If 8.1 adds a few extra features then that's a bonus for me.
Which projector are you using for your setup?
