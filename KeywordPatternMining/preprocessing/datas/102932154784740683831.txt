I must admit I was disappointed with that as well. They made it look as there were going to be loads. What's worse is that Sony have not made new watch faces open and easy to develop. All custom watch faces are in the form of actual apps that have to be run constantly. I think Sony have limited the watch faces to these 5 minimal colourless ones so that they can claim good battery life with time display always on. I've not tried any of the custom watch face apps but my guess is that they'd eat up a lot more battery. It's a damn shame actually, cos one of the big attractions for me was the assumption that you could change the style of the display to loads of different designs whenever you want!
Did you ever find that app?
That's a bit of crap, dodgy marketing then!
Will that widget only be available for Z1 owners? Or any Android phone? In the meantime I'm using Poweramp and it's accompanying SmartWatch app which are both excellent.
