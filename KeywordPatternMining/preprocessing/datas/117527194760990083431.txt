I'm torn between the NEX-6 and the GX7. Nex-6 is cheaper and has the bigger APS-C sensor but the GX7 has a wider variety of lenses and some form of in built stabilisation.
+ Edward Bartel That's a problem for me :/. No good camera stores on this tiny island I live on. I would have to go on multiple impressions I read and watch online.
+ Frederick Van Johnson no I don't live in the US. I live on a tiny island called Malta in the Mediterranean sea. + Edward Bartel I have considered the OM-D E-M5 especially with the imminent price drop after PhotoPlusc but the lack of focus peaking is a bummer and firmware support by Oly has been very limited from what I've read.
