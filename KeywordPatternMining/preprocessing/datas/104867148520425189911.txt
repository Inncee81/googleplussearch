Do we all need our computers filling up with 36mp RAW files. I doubt it. I'm sure these will make a dent, but, as Sony reduces the size of full frame goodness, Panasonic is reducing the size of M43 goodness. Look at the dinky little GM-1 that it launched a couple of hours ago. I think there's probably plenty of room in the market for both formats. I do think, however, that Canon and Nikon should be taking note. Sony have the potential to decimate their markets.
I'm glad you allowed a little bit of reality to enter your article at the end. Of course, to be totally accurate, you should measure the Moon's altitude from its centre, not from it's closest point. In that situation, the Moon would already have collided with the Earth (Moon's radius = 1080 miles, ISS orbit = 230 miles). I suspect the sky wouldn't be blue any more, if, indeed, the sky even existed after that collision.
Sorry Sony, you're too late. I got my new camera a couple of weeks ago. That said, they look good, if a tad angular.
I almost questioned the 4x bit, thinking it's a 2x crop factor how can it be 4x bigger. Then I thought again, and looked at the various graphical comparisons online. D'oh!

My rationale for buying a new camera (admittedly it fails most of the time) is "Me want".

+ Arthur Chang I signed up for prime.com the first time I saw it mentioned here. I never received an invite. Are you just taking your time to get it right or did I miss the invite somehow.
