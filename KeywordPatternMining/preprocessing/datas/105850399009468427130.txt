+ Lee Casey Me, on the other hand, very experienced in taking SLR/DSLR pictures and post processing disagrees with you. I do refer to knowledge of the fact that I am not a user that can't see issues. I do agree the superior auto needs refining but to judge the camera in this negative way rather judges the user than the hardware. Mine works like a charm and I can create excellent pictures. I have seen other posts with bad pictures as well as super compositions with this phone. And also, as a sidenote - the camera will get better..
No, you didn't get the point. The point is that a person used to take pictures in production, hobbies etc see differences than the regular user which is happy with whatever, which means my expectations are higher than average but with the understanding the phone has it limits, just like a compact. I wrote this in short earlier which wasn't clear enough. I will review your pictures once I am at desktop computer.
+ Lee Casey i forgot to mention I have seen different results in between Z1 and Z1 of the same subject. Maybe there is both a good and a less good version. (software). Strange but this is what I think. Once I check your post i will try and reproduce what you did and see if there are any differences.
+ Gordon Simpson I can't have Samsung at my work due to lawsuits. My sister has a S4. The only thing which is better when I compared is blacks on screen and viewing angle. Nothing else. And esp. Touchwiz makes me crazy. Im used to Nexus phones. + Lee Casey I will now check your pictures to see if I can see a similar result from my Z1. I will also supply two photos I took today with mine and try and replicate your result.
+ Lee Casey The HTC wins in your comparision. But I also want to point out in similar tests that my Z1 performs better than this. I believe there are different camera firmwares out hence the results. Anyway - because of who created this thread I can't be too informative but it will get better.
