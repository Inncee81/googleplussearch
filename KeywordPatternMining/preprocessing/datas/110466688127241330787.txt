#delete9 . I really really love the silhouetted geese. I wish they were a bit more of the star. I'd love to see this as a pano crop.
#save6 Love the purple and orange color combination and all the beautiful details in the center. Very Georgia O'Keefe.
#save1 I like that I can see the blur on Mr Bee's wings. Love all the pollen he's lugging around, although do wish the bg was a little simpler.
#save7 I do agree with + Nev Nels about the sky - I wish it wasn't so muddy looking. The upper right was off the most to me. But I do like the tractor, and all the cool details in it. And the desaturation goes well with the old fella.
#delete7 The slope in the grass is fine, it's on a hill for those that live in the flatlands ;-) But I'm not a fan of the heavy processing - the whites are yellow/gray and the whole image feels dark.
#delete8 Beautiful buildings and square, I think a different composition would have shown them off more though.
I hope you do post them all!! Love all the intricate details in the old doors.
Oops. Sorry. I do wish some logic would apply to seeing multiple source posts though.
