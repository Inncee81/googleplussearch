Gyah, I can't wait 'til my Fido contract is up and I can go back to Wind... What a mistake switching was.
+ Michael Bazdell "unlimited canada-wide" doesn't mean that you'll get coverage canada-wide, just that if you don't get charged long distance for calling people outside of Ottawa. And Barrhaven (I assume you're in Barrhaven? That's the only place in Ottawa I get poor coverage) is on their map as part of their expansion area in the next year or two. Wind service will probably arrive around the same time the trains come, and civilization starts to settle in. Apart from there, and some of the further out bits of Kanata, I get more consistent reception with my Wind phone than I do my Fido phone. Fido only doesn't cost so much extra for roaming because they're secretly just Rogers.
