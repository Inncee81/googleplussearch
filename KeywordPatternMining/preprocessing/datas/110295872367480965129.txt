I'm not trying to hate on the iPhone. But my LG G2 can go toe to toe with the new iPhone any day.
IPhone has a dual core processor, LG has quad core. My battery is almost double the capacity. 13 megapixel camera to iPhones 8. LG has a higher resolution screen also. This is on phone arena if you don't believe me. Unfortunately, the new iPhone is just a slightly improved version of the 5 with a fresh coat of paint. Maybe when the 6 comes out next year it will be something new and innovative.
Apple is also good at selling you the exact same device year after year.
I'm not sure what benchmarks you're referring too. And maybe the iPhone is slightly faster. But the battery, camera and other great features of G2 trump the new iPhone any day.
If you bought an iPhone 5S and enjoy it then good for you. But if you went from a 5 to a 5S then apple screwed you into purchasing almost the exact same device. I sell phones for Verizon and get to use all the new phones that come out. I'm not impressed with Apple at all. Steve Jobs is probably rolling over in his gold plated coffin.
I'm don't work for Verizon. I sell phones for all carriers. I'm a 3rd party retailer. Just wanted to clarify before you get a full chubber over the situation. But let's face it, IPhone lovers will be die hard for iPhone and droid lovers will defend Android to the bitter end. Trying to convince the other is about as effective as pissing into the wind.
I'd have to agree with you. Every LG smartphone that has come out has been garbage. But I really like the G2. They got it right with this one.
