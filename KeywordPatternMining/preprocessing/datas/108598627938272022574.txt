The updates to windows 8 still aren't enough to get me to go to it. The primary issues that still cause me time loss as a developer aren't addressed. If and when MS decides to get serious about supporting the business based model again I might look at it. I've already moved 99% of stuff to linux. Looking at the market change they would have to do a hell of a lot to get me to shell out the money for another Windows OS.
+ Philip Oberg Which is why you haven't ran into issues. You don't really use it for productivity or development. Stuff that you want multiple windows open at once and not to have to deal with the app screen. Some like myself who has codeblocks, MS visual studio, notepad++, gimp,blender, command boxes open, command prompts, opennx, netbeans, eclypse, Not to mention I may be recording and editing video, google chrome, because its web tools, and many others. If you are managing multiple sites, doing development and testing, or editing and so on. Makes windows 8 an nightmare. It was easier and more efficient to move most of it over to linux rather than upgrade. I can always duel boot or run windows 7 in a virtual machine. The way I see the market moving I see less and less reason to keep supporting windows even in the game market there are changes coming about.
Put Mohammed on one and lets see how Muslims React.
Its funnier if you are visiting someone else's office and can hang it by theirs when no one is paying attention.
Not what I would consider a work station. Over glorified all-in-one pc is all. I'd at least want hardware based raid level 5 or 10 with a ssd for drive cache and then maybe 15k or so boot drive.
