+ Richard Dixon Yeah, it looks really good. I might get a Wii U again when there are 5-6 must-have games for it. This would be one of them.
Still haven't completed the new Tomb Raider game. Maybe after GTA, but by that time the PS4 will probably be out. Let's see if I ever have the time to get back to TR. p.s. have you completed Murder Files yet?
I can see my copy of Soul Reaver here from my desk, for the Dreamcast actually :).
I'd definitely go for Need for Speed Rivals instead. Still not sure which PS4 launchtitles I'm getting though ..
I'm still playing it, not at the end yet!
+ Richard Dixon No, trying to finish it but I've got too many other things going on. Got some big Murder Files news very soon. Still at work right now, spending all my time building spreadsheets. Ah, the adrenaline-fuelled life of a game producer :P.
I find these Android TV boxes quite interesting, but I think the OUYA isn't good enough in order to get a high enough marketshare. Which is why I don't have any plans to bring Murder Files to it. I need to see the potential and know that it can get some traction. I just don't feel that with the OUYA. Just an example of development cost - the Murder Files team consists of 5 people. Bringing the game to OUYA probably takes about 4 weeks in total. So multiply the monthly salaries of these 5 people times 4 and it doesn't sound like it will be worth it.
+ Richard Dixon 3DS is definitely interesting. I'll have a think about that :). The future is about accessible platforms. Smartphones have shown how you can get games into the hands of the masses. That's where it's at. Nintendo, Sony and MS will have their own share in the marketplace but besides that it will be about clever ways to make it even easier to get games to more people.
