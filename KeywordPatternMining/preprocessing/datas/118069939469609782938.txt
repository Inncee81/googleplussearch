+ Frederick Van Johnson if you just add auto focus to your original statement, it would be correct ;)
+ Brian Gudas + Frederick Van Johnson Hey guys, any news on discount code for Thanksgiving shopping season
Manual equatorial telescope mount would be cheaper and more stable option
Great portrait + Frederick Van Johnson + Doug Kaye looks like he is proud of that camera
+ Frederick Van Johnson when can we expect this episode of AAtG?
This review seams to be little bit out of character for you + Gordon Laing More emotional than analytical. It almost looks like you are trying to convince yourself that you don't need this camera ;)
+ Gordon Laing Don't get me wrong, I did like it. It's just that I noticed different vibe in this video. Actually I would like to see more videos like this one
+ Gordon Laing In the crop mode, A7R would give you 16 MP and A7 would be 10 MP
+ Gordon Laing did you have a chance to try existing (APS-C) 35 and 50mm f1.8 E mount lenses, to see how much of the FF sensor are they covering
Thanks + Gordon Laing it would be nice if they could cover 24X24mm square, anything over would be great.
+ Erkki Juurus ND filter YES, manual focus + focus peaking YES, zebra YES with a user-selected threshold headphone jack for monitoring YES, adjustable mic input level YES Or, does the multi-function hotshoe work with the Sony XLR/shotgun mic accessory YES Plus clean HDMI out, with the option for uncompressed 4:2:2 video output
I like the body design, kind of soft and angular at the same time
Great shot + Gordon Laing I would like to see this with 7.5mm fisheye
+ Robert LeBlanc I see you missed this part of instructions ;) "If you have any feedback on the survey, please don't post it in the comments, as that might influence the results of others. You can always write me a private post instead by sharing a message with me only and tagging me in it."
I'm in Milwaukee Wisconsin, around hour and twenty minutes drive from O'Hare airport. If this is a weekend visit I wouldn't mind driving there.
Only one problem + Gordon Laing this is a bicycle with training wheels ;)
