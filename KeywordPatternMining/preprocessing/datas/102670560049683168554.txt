+ Jake Weisz actually no samsung, sony, amazon, htc will make stuff from aosp they have their own dialer,calendar, notes taking app etc Google making theirs a part of aosp doesn't seem to make any sense anymore. So Aosp will be only focused on Android improvements just the base of android, while Google can update their experience on android through the play store and by the looks of it even for custom roms I guess you'll only need to load the play store now and you'd get all the google apps from the play store. If I am right which I might not be this is a win win for everyone essentially. For this to work I hope google fixes it's country restrictions even though I've always used swiftkey, I find it odd that Google Keyboard can't be installed in my country from the play store :/
