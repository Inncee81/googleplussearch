If it is as well built as the RX1 they'll be onto a winner, particularly at that price.
The RX1 and RX100 are pretty incredible (each in their own way). I find the RX1 much more enjoyable to use than the EM5, except the EM5's focusing is so much faster. Hopefully the A7 has a decent AF speed otherwise it'd be a tough call on whether to move from the EM5.
