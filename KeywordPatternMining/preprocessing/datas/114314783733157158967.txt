As far as CC, I have to agree on the National reciprocity. It's kind of ridiculous that I can get a CC here in PA that covers Utah though when Utah requires training and PA doesn't. A National standard would be nice. Also, I wonder if having some teachers - not forcing anyone who didn't want it - trained and carrying would have done anything to deter the school as a target. Realistically the only reason - I may be naive on this - that schools get targeted is that no one there can resist. One trained and willing person with a CC might just be able to stop an untrained assailant with an assault rifle. I'll allow that I could be full of it on all of this though.
