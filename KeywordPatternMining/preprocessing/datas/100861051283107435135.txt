I got my new phone now and it seems to work properly. I tried the Playmemories too and there is a campaign toggle. I switched it to on but I too had to fill in credit card information...
But why credit card demands? Shall I turn the campaign off?
Updates are always good. My Z1 is a bit weired. After restart I get the question which language I want... This should only be requested once ... Also the start up guide did not start as first thing when I started the phone for the first time. I hade to open it under settings... Do you think my phone needs to be replaced?
+ Stefan Svartling I had the same thoughts...
+ Hakan Gül Yes I changed from regular (mini sim) to micro sim. Only iPhone use nano sim I am told. But in the future all devices will most likely have nano sim.
+ Stefan Svartling new phone ordered. They promise a dock too:-)
+ Hakan Gül Aha I only have one sim card. When I have reset my previous phones I always am prompted to go through the set up guide and connect to my Google account. This did not happen with the Z1 so something must be wrong. + Stefan Svartling have you gotten the update yet? I am curious of what has improved.
I guess the same as big Brother...
Is it any good? Better than Evernote or Google Keep?
In Sweden the Z1 is rather cheap when chosing Halebop. I have 3 now and they suck, imo. "The fight for more satisfied customers" is good on paper only. I need the reception quality from Telia but Halebop uses Telia's network and is cheaper.
+ Jonas Björk easy. Don't bringa in the shower... I don't think IP classing includes schampoo ;-)
