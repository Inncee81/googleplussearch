+ Jeff Motter The current U.S. system with its bought lobby politics has absolutely ZERO to do with communism. Jeez, McCarthy, stop parroting and educate yourself.
Domestic: Lower taxes for small and medium-sized businesses. Get the money by collecting from large corps and banks. Stop their taxlaw loophole lobbying. And while at it, stop money in politics for good. Foreign: Learn from the chinese. They DO have thousands of years more experience. Influence through trade: - trade benefits the own economy - saves shitloads of cash - saves lives - really makes the world a nicer place for our kids Take all the incoming money and invest into education -> innovation -> jobs
+ Shawn McMahon Nope. What WAS at hand was what I meant by mentioning him. And that is a culture of ruminant fingerpointing and calling people communists without any reasonable backing just to discredit.
+ Shawn McMahon That's just not what happened. However, the point is, that it would be really beneficial for the discussion if this "cry communist" would stop. It makes the yeller look like an idiot you don't want to get into an argument to begin with. Why waste the chance to use a precise name-calling? And yes, there are lots...
+ Shawn McMahon Agree. Just that the scale is really, really different.
