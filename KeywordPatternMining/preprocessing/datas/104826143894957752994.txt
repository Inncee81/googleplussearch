+ Julianne Boyle , how can it be turned off? I post some of my blog entries (which I feel are suitable, not unethical) on a specific category of several communities, so it shows up several times on my own news feed (I think that's an FB term lol). How do I make sure that these posts do not come up repeatedly on my G+ profile?
Thanks +Julianne Boyle, apparently I just did this a while ago before I read this post. Silly me lol
