Investing in this company is a tough call -- when they have an awful record for support after the sale. Firmware updates if any are slow, when compared to the hottest competitor, Fuji. I don't have a Fuji but from what I've heard their lenses are without peer - and they have bag full to choose from. Not to mention a 1/2 way decent price point. so what is my point - I'm really excited about the Sony - but I'm a bit shy. I had the 7 - shooting raw was a pain to pull anything out of the file - when I can basically add sharpness to my Nikon V1 files and call it good. I loved the res from the 7 though. And - hopefully a shutter speed min. will be coupled to Auto ISO - then I would be really happy.
