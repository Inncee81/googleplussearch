What route are you planning to take + Michael Murphy ? In case I'm in town, I will definitely join you.
Beautiful! I have only been geo-tagging my photospheres. So, I pin point where I took it from.
Mike - how does one get to do a visit along with stalwarts such as yourself? Would love to have an opportunity to learn from you whilst visiting this wonderful building.
Oh! Impossible for me to be a part of it in that case But it is wonderful to see your work, as always.
So where did you acquire the cloak of invisibility?
