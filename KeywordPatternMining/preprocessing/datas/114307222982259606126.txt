I'm not a programmer, so I'm sorry if this doesn't really make sense, but is the new code you need for proper 4.4 support replacing (some of) the intents the apps are currently using? If that is the case: Would it not also have to mean that this must somehow work pre-4.4, else those SMS apps would stop working on pre-4.4? Or do I just need more coffee before pretending to understand stuff?
