I might get this lens, I don't have the patience to wait forever for the Olympus 35-150...!
Very nice write up and information, Mat!
No I haven't yet...unfortunately, Olympus doesn't seem to have any EM1 "try before you buy" events near where I live. I prefer the size and shape of the EM5, so I'd really like to feel it in my hands first. Otherwise, I will just hope for the successor to the EM5 whenever it arrives. I am in no big hurry, although it'd be nice to have in time for photos for my new book I'm writing on figures/lighting!
