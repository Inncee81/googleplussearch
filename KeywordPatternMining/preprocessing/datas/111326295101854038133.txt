I learned on my dad's 35mm Hanimex SLR with multiple various lenses which much to my delight I found also fit my Chinon (with some adapter rings) when I got it thereby increasing my choice of lenses 2-or 3 fold! I believe for me my first camera of my very own was a Kodak instamatic 44. Then an all manual 35mm SLR film camera Chinon brand with various Tamron lenses.From there I got a Fugji 7.1 megapixel digital point and shoot more less. Currently I have a digital SLR Canon T2i with a Sigma 18-200 mm lens with optical stabilizer. I totally love it! I have still not learned everything I can do with it and I got it I think back in late 2010.
