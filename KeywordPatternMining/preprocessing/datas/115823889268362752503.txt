Personally I don't have an issue with my battery. It lasts me from home out to home in. And coming from a BB Pearl 3G, N900 and Sony Neo, these were all the same (and the peral had a 1" screen!!!). So I feel for a 5" screen, it does really well. Your use and setting up of the phone determines a lot. On pure standby the phone lasts me 3 days and for a smart phone I think that this a great. I feel asking for a smartphone with a 5" screen with good hardware and processing power to last longer than a day is like asking a 17.3" gaming laptop to last more than two hours on battery, its all in proportion. As for the heat factor, it's waterproof with no where for the heat to escape being held in hands that are the average temperature of 30 deg C already, I think we have to do the math on that one...
