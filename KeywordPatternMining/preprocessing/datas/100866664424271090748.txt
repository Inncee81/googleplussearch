Wown injuat got an om-d. Person sold me his so he could get the newer version do out soon, have to check out this lens.
So, you are selling all of your canon gear what are you going to use to take those awesome car photos.
I just bought a Olympus OM-d M5. Since I injured my right wrist last year carry my big Canon's just kill it. I will still keep my big boys for some things but for now my daily camera will be this little guy. Takes amazingly good photos.
Understand how you feel. I will still keep my 5D Mkii just can not beat it for ease of use and outstanding image quality. But this little Olympus more than holds its own against the 7d so far.
We can only hope. Sony A99 is pretty cool but I would need a lot of $$$$$. To change bodies and lenses. Have a good night. Good luck.
This would be cool to use at the drag strip. Maybe then I can get a clear photo of a dragster.
Man that looks awesome, wherw did your get it printed at?
Thanks + Joshua Meyer I appreciate the information I will check them out since some folks actually want some of my work. Yea.
