From the leaks I've seen, the N4 looks much nicer.
The leaked N5 just looks cheap. At least they made an effort with the N4.
Guys. This phone works under water. It's gonna have thicker bezels than the other phones. It's well built and water resistant.
I have the Z1 and I think it's a great camera. So do these guys... ﻿ This is a technical review of the smartphone cameras. And they pit the Z1 two points better than the 1020!
Haha. You guys haven't got a clue. Bloatware? The features are actually useful. And if you want to take a picture then press the shutter button from the lockscreen, or whenever for that matter. Don't bash what you don't know + Alexandre Bote Tronchoni & + Waza_Be
Bloat = Useless weight/Software. I know what it is. I remove it from laptops that people buy from high street stores. Do you have the Z1 + Waza_Be ?
It's ok + Waza_Be I saw the previous comments. But I have the Z1 and the "few" extras Sony include in the software are not bloat. They're not counter productive. Also Sony's software is as close to stock as can be. They just add a few things. Like the camera effects and the multi-window multitasking with Small Apps.
What features are you looking for + Eng Sin Sern ?
Your right + Waza_Be The other OEM's are stuffing useless extras into Android and their UI isn't that nice. Samsung is the worst for this. The point it the Z1 is awesome. And my other phone is a Nexus 4.
+ Eng Sin Sern The only advantage is that the 1020 has a slightly bigger sensor and higher resolution. I can't make comparisons cause I don't own the 1020 but the Z1 takes great pictures. And I got the QX10 with my Z1 so I get better shots than the 1020 anyways.
Yep its a nice freebie + John M Catral and turns any smartphone into a very nice compact camera with a 10x optical zoom. And it will record video remotely too.
Oh + John M Catral Definitely go for the QX100. It's basically an RX100 Mark II without the LCD, the smartphone display becomes the LCD view finder, and if you Google the RX100 MkII you'll see how fantastic it is. Rave reviews for the RX100, so the QX100 is going to be amazing.
Something isn't right there. You should get at least 5 hours screen time.
That's why I've not brought the new Nexus 7. I had the old N7 and pretty much any modern smartphone performed better. The new one still lacks. I'll stick with Android 'phones but I'm going for a Windows tablet next.
That's not much at all + Mark Lastiwka When a Nexus 4 can run rings round the Nexus 7 you know somethings up.

Ok. I see lots of mixed opinions on the Sony Xperia Z1 camera. This report might surprise a few...
Well... That's HTC off the list. My girlfriend has the iPhone 4S and 5 and wants an Android phone. Checked it out briefly... And it frustrated me as much as it did her! Sense kills the HTC One!
Haha! I like the Pun + Pedro Burgos ! See that would be Ok but its on our business account. So O2 has to stock it. I have the N4 and love stock. I also have the Z1 and love the Sony software. After we looked at the HTC One I took my Z1 out and just the software buttons sold it. Then she saw the white Z1 and liked it. For me it's Nexus == Sony > Other OEMs.
I agree. This might cause controversy but could Sony be the 'Premium Nexus?' They build solid, beautiful phones, and stay true to Pure Android with subtle changes and a few additions to 'said' software.
The HTC One feels great, has a great display, and the speakers are awesome. No hate, just Sense makes or breaks it. Also the Z1 is a completely different to the Z + Pedro Burgos Its great Android has variety though. Makes it interesting.
I've just grabbed it for my devices. Trying to find out how secure it is. Looking good so far.

I knew it! The original is 4896 x 2752! So much detail is missing from this....
That's the problem I think. I've turned auto upload off. Which means any photo I upload manually will be significantly compressed. Shame I can't edit the picture here.

Haha. I just got a little feeling Google is laughing at these and our responses right now.
I've been trying to get my Nexus to do this. I even checked the Play Store for an app lol!
It's 2013. Everything leaks. So enjoy this Google + Nexus 5 hands-on video!
I don't blame you. I'm thinking this is a very early mock up or this is fake.
Google+, the New User Ad Associations, & Transparency Everyone will have their opinions about Google+'s announcement that starting in November they may use user's names and/or profile photos in association with ads for brands they have recommended on Google+. This post isn't to debate whether or not that is wise, good, ethical, fattening, or whatever. I just want to set the record straight for those who are saying this is as bad (or even worse) than Facebook when they instituted a similar policy. The one area in which there can be no argument is that Google+, unlike Facebook, went above and beyond in this instance to be transparent, to fully inform users, and to make it easy for them to opt out of the new change. Since yesterday, I have seen: 1. An email from Google+ 2. A blue bar at the top of the screen when I log in to Google about the change, with "Learn more" and "Change settings" links 3. A notification in my Google+ notifications about the change and my options. Again, even if you don't like that they are doing this associating people with ads thing, you have to admit they are handling it proactively and transparently with users.
He went on the run after his neighbour was found dead. He made billions from the anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can turn you invisible on the internet: John McAfee tells us why he fled from police, what he thinks of Edward Snowden's leaks and why he's pinning his hopes on a $100 gadget.
I think the tech is there to make us invisible on the internet but the agencies will do their best to deter it. After all they want to know everything about everyone.

Sony Xperia Z1 review Read the full version: It takes more than a good smartphone to eclipse Samsung’s bright Galaxies. On paper, the Sony Xperia Z1 has it all – looks, build, specs, camera, software. But will the sum of these strengths outweigh the Xperia Z1’s weaknesses? Does the Z1 rise above the flaws of its predecessor? By + Joshua Vergara #Sony #XperiaZ1 #SonyXperiaZ1
Multi-Window multitasking on the Sony Xperia Z1... Awesome! #Sony #XperiaZ1 #Honami
Yea sure + Chetan Dhawan Press the Task button and click on the purple icon that looks like a crop picture. A floating window will appear... Click on Capture screen
Seriously, This R/C Helicopter is so hard to fly!
Haha! You would laugh + Lee Casey Dropped it from 10ft twice already. I wanna learn so I can strap my old Galaxy S2 to it to record an ariel video. This is gonna take me ages!
Here's another picture comparison! #QX10 #XperiaZ1 #Nexus4 #GalaxyS2
Gotta say. The Nexus is beaten by the two year old Galaxy S2...
True + Fakhruddin Darwis Something I should try when I get some time.
Here's another picture comparison! #QX10 #XperiaZ1 #Nexus4 #GalaxyS2
For me the colour reproduction of the Nexus is off. The S2 is great for 2 year old tech, better than the Nexus 4, and it's colours "pop" slightly in a nice way. The Z1 and QX10 do it for me even if a little under exposed? I like the colour reproduction of the Sony equipment here.
Woah! A monster truck kills spectators in an event in Mexico.
It's a feature added to Jelly Bean and was initially available on Nexus devices. Is not built in to the Z1, you have to download and install the stock gallery which includes the photosphere function.
I installed Google's stock Gallery, which comes with the Google camera and the photosphere function.
Here you go + Mark Taylor This is where I got it from...
Yep. You need less frames in the upper and lower sections, because of the large sensor. But Yea works great!
Nexus 4 - mind-blowing ! and battery too...
It's a reshare from + Piotr Wajner + Francesco Anglani ﻿ I think it's his nexus 4
This is probably down to a faulty battery charge controller on the device. The only way this happens is if the battery is subjected to excessive voltage...
This is what I thought + Matt Taylor Batteries have release vents to prevent this from happening. ﻿Well, before it gets to this stage anyway.
The obvious ones are stick to high quality chargers that provide 5VDC. If you use the correct chargers and this still happens then I'd suspect a faulty handset.
Picked up this toy today.... Taken with #XperiaZ1
Smartphone Photo comparison - Galaxy S2 - Nexus 4 - Xperia Z1 - QX10 I'm no photographer but I can get better shots than this. All pictures taken in Auto modes. #XperiaZ1 #QX10 #Nexus4 #GalaxyS2
I used the superior auto on the Z1. I've taken some great shots with it.
I've got some more comparisons but generally the Nexus 4 is washy. The S2 is surprisingly good, although it, and the Nexus 4, don't like low light scenes. But its always between the Z1 and the QX10. I'll post some more maybe tomorrow.
Just received the Magnetic Charging Cable for my Z1! It's great to be able to charge it without having to pull the flap. #XperiaZ1 #Sony #Honami
Got it from Amazon. Its for the Z but it fits the Z1.
£14 is pretty good + IHAG Gadget Blog if it means I don't need to pull the flap anymore. Also its just the USB cable. So I plug it into the Sony X1 charger. + Mitch Gersbach this is the official item for the Z but it fits the Z1 perfectly
Takes the same time to charge + Christopher Weise Very impressed with it. And I think the Dock comes with this cable too. But you have to unscrew it from the actual dock.
Its one of the accessories I wanted as soon as I got the Z1. And its worth it. Its very easily detached but that's OK. If you snag the cable accidentally then your phone will be safe.
Since using it I'd say its a little faster. But I'm gonna see if that's true with a full charge from 0.
That's using the official 1.5A charger.

Your right + Waza_Be The other OEM's are stuffing useless extras into Android and their UI isn't that nice. Samsung is the worst for this. The point it the Z1 is awesome. And my other phone is a Nexus 4.
+ Eng Sin Sern The only advantage is that the 1020 has a slightly bigger sensor and higher resolution. I can't make comparisons cause I don't own the 1020 but the Z1 takes great pictures. And I got the QX10 with my Z1 so I get better shots than the 1020 anyways.
Yep its a nice freebie + John M Catral and turns any smartphone into a very nice compact camera with a 10x optical zoom. And it will record video remotely too.
Oh + John M Catral Definitely go for the QX100. It's basically an RX100 Mark II without the LCD, the smartphone display becomes the LCD view finder, and if you Google the RX100 MkII you'll see how fantastic it is. Rave reviews for the RX100, so the QX100 is going to be amazing.
Guys. This phone works under water. It's gonna have thicker bezels than the other phones. It's well built and water resistant.
I have the Z1 and I think it's a great camera. So do these guys... ﻿ This is a technical review of the smartphone cameras. And they pit the Z1 two points better than the 1020!
Haha. You guys haven't got a clue. Bloatware? The features are actually useful. And if you want to take a picture then press the shutter button from the lockscreen, or whenever for that matter. Don't bash what you don't know + Alexandre Bote Tronchoni & + Waza_Be
Bloat = Useless weight/Software. I know what it is. I remove it from laptops that people buy from high street stores. Do you have the Z1 + Waza_Be ?
It's ok + Waza_Be I saw the previous comments. But I have the Z1 and the "few" extras Sony include in the software are not bloat. They're not counter productive.

The Z1 has huge power through the headphone socket. Its a great device!
