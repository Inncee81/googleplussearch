Having personally worked on this stuff and seen the internal machinations churning, "a traditional private insurer" does not cover all private insurers. Unfair, TBH.
Not just from a tech side, but from a UX perspective as well. For once I have to be guarded in what I say, but again, just choosing one private insurer to use? Sweeping.
