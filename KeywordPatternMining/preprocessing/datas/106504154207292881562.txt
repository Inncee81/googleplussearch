I thought for sure Benoit was going to give up the game. I hate him as a pitcher. I was pleasantly surprised to see he didn't give up 5 runs.
Nah. tigers will take 6. It's typically (though not always) their MO. "You won the last one? Our turn." Of course... they didn't do too well against the Red Sox earlier in the season either. But i am calling tigers in 6 and as much as it hurts me to say it, Sox in 7.
I'm still debating on if I want to check it out or not. Don't have an invite anyway, but I am not sure if I'd like this launcher. All the pics i've seen of it have been kinda.. cartoony.
+ Elias Ortega - I'm not one to scoff anything tech unless I get the chance to try it (or it has some feature that really irks me).. so I am definitely interested in giving it a shot. + Alexander Maxham - Wasn't just yours, though. All the screen shots I've seen have been that way. But in truth, I am more about functionality anyway. Here's a question... one thing I noted while reading another's post about it, it changes your backdrop on your homescreen. Is that toggleable (I would assume it is - but haven't seen it to be "optional" anywhere)? I have a custom that I'd like to keep.
Oh... and + Elias Ortega - I just added you to my geeks circle. Take a peek at my ABOUT page and let me know if there are any other categories into which you may fall.
Alright... will add you to Ingress. and I'll give Aviate a shot. But I won't hold your inferior faction against you. :P
