+ Roman Ruiz + Sony Xperia WHINING!??! well then so be it,@Roman Ruiz you'd be doing the same if the product you trusted in conked off in under a week. And yes I'am whining coz I didn't spend so much to get added headaches. And from what i read online this is not a defective piece issue, a lot of them seems to be facing a similar problem with the phone. It seems to be a bug with the phone. And i read somewhere someone even got it repaired at a Sony service center only to have the same problem again in couple of days!!! So yes i'm whining coz money maybe growing on trees for you + Roman Ruiz ,but out here we strive for it. 34k doesn't come easy. And i didn't ask for any of this when i spend through my nose!
Yeah now I'm thinking that's what I shlIould have done considering its already been an hour at the service centre
