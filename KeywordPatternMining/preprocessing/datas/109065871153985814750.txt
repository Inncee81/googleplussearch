they have reported stereo speakers on this one. And when I had my nexus 4, it lasted 24 hours plus with some rooting.
There is nothing "Adult" about surrendering to a man that, with the help of his toadies, put the government on shutdown. Neither party has been doing their job. I agree that the agenda behind the republicans is backed by large corporations anyway. This whole situation looks like congressman are getting pressure by their lobbyists. I don't particularly like Obama in any sense, but I hope that he refrains from giving spoiled ass children what they want. If he does, then it will be considered normal politics.
If we don't run debt up further, then fine, let it burn. That is adult. Cut all funding to everything. No national government. Just state governments. /sarcasm. Simple start, cut off tax credits, all of them. Government subsidies to big corps and farmer's subsidies. Get rid of the bubble that way in our money market. Don't touch medicaid and Social Security because we paid for that. And bam. That alone will help tremendously. The people have to get over the January-April christmas though.
