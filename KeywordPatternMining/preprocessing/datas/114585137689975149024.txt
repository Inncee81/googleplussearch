Reading your post, I'm very tempted to visit Okinawa. My wife's bother is there at this moment, so very topical for me. Great photos as usual.
+ Martin Irwin wonderful, arrive Tokyo next Monday, depart Friday, will call for a beer one evening
+ Martin Irwin a series of great images, the view through the temple (I assume) out over the roofs is superb
Nice images and read, love the Engrish. Still enjoying the RX1?
UK was very nice tks. Great August weather, warm/dry, balmy evenings. Does look a touch burnt after the hot summer. Good to hear you're enjoying the RX1, such a great compact camera. Back in Tokyo mid Sept, will speak with you prior.
