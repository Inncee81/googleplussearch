+ David Bailey um, I'm hoping that was a typo! Lol!
+ Ron Ng but Rose and the ninth doctor or Rose and the tenth doctor?
Loved that game! Played it in the arcades and on the Atari. Along with dig dug, space invaders, galaga, Q-Bert, etc. My family would go on vacation to Niagara Falls every year. There's this steep street that used to have several huge arcades. My brother and I would hit those while the girls went to the wax museum. Good times!
