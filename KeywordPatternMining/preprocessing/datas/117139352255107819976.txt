+ George Hayes couldn't disagree more. I've been coding for 20 years and have no issues coding, recording music, editing video or photos on Windows. I write java and c++ apps using eclipse. I use cygwin rather than dos. I went through my Linux phase using Ubuntu and Fedora for a while. In the end I prefer the windows desktop environment. FYI, windows 8 still has a desktop and you can have multiple windows open.
