Does it have to be a laser? I was looking for something similar (without the need to connect Crapple toys) and ended up with the HP OfficeJet 8600 Pro 'business ink' printer. It's superb. Quick, good quality print, cheap to run - with duplex printing and scanning...
None of those problems with the HP business ink printers - and high capacity cartridges at much, much better price per page than laser. I had a Samsung mono laser. Paper feed was a bit iffy and toner for it was almost impossible to find, which was a pain because they were very low capacity cartridges, but other than that it was average... (By the way, it sounds like you've used Epson inkjets...)
I assumed it was. They're the only inkjets that behave in the way you described! The 8600 is down to £179 at Currys - I paid just under £300 for mine and still think I got a bargain. That's about the price of a set of toner cartridges. What have you got to lose...?
A full set of the high yield ones is £90 or so. According to the printer stats it has done 7322 pages. I'm on my third set of carts (including the ones that came with it), but they current set is half to three quarters full... And the low price hardware vs expensive supplies model is even worse on colour lasers! That's a £300 printer that takes £240 worth of toner cartridges...
