Just my opinion, but what kills many of these phones is carrier and manufacturer bloatware. HTC and others have great hardware, but software on top of software on top of software kills a great experience. Google and the manufacturers need to do like Apple and insist on a pure vanilla experience. Many people I know with these phones that are unlocked and rooted are much happier.
