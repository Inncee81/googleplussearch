Just got my QX10 as a gift for my wife. Now to save for the QX100 as a gift for myself hehehe... By the way, I went to the Sony Store at Roosevelt Field Mall in Long Island NY to buy it, as I was doing so, lots of commotion happened as cops and security guards started looking for a guy who went on a shooting rampage in the area. I hope no one got hurt or worse...
