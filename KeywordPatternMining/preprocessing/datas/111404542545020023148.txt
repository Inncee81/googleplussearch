Facebook is not going to steal your images, if they happen to scroll by one in some video ad or something it'll probably be the best thing that ever happened to you. Also nobody could sue facebook for using such a photo without a model release because the "model" or person in the photo is not the actual subject but rather the photo itself is the subject as I'm sure facebook's lawyers would point out if anyone had the guts to try and take facebook to court
