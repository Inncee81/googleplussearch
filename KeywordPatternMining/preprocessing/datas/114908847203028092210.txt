Hi + Gordon Laing .. are there any adaptors for nikon glass for the A7r?.. I am guessing the Nikon - NEX7 adaptors wont work??..
+ Trey Ratcliff .. isnt that the speed booster?.. thats designed to increase the aperture of a fx lense on a crop sensor body (focuses the light captured by the larger FX lense down to crop sensor size capturing more light over the crop sensor - or something like that.. ).. So can the NEX lenses can fit on the A7r?.. if that is the case then any of the current standard Nikon to NEX adaptors like the novaflex should work.. and you can put the 14-24mm on the A7r.. EDIT----- I guess this is the adaptor you are referring to..
+ Trey Ratcliff .. are you planning on getting some Leica glass for the A7r??
+ Trey Ratcliff .. i think the NEX adaptors will fit on the A7r.. so you could get a nikon to nex adaptor and use ur nikon glass on the A7r.. 14-24mm on the sony?.. of does that kill the main benefit of the sonys??.. size??..
+ Gordon Laing is prob sleeping like a baby at the moment!!.. LOL
+ sonylearntv .. interms of image quality.. I am guessing that the sony lenses are optimised for the sony cameras.. it would be interesting to see a side by side comparison of the same scene with nikon glass compared to sony glass.. for me.. I see the A7r as a perfect backup camera if I can use it with my nikon glass effectively..
atta boy + Gordon Laing .. what would we do without ya!!..
Never noticed how big your hards were before + Gordon Laing .. or is that just a very small camera??.. hmmmmm..
It'll change in a few weeks.. dont get too use to it!!!..
