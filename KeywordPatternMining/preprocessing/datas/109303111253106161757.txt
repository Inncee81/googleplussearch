The price is actually pretty competitive if you check it out. Add your credit card's charge for an international purchase and delivery and it is cheaper to buy here.
Their model naming makes it a chore to find on the site.
Did you see that they have a remote commander that shows compatibility with the A7's?
I'm making a savings plan for this thing now and going to get it for my birthday, it can't get much better than this camera for my needs for years to come unless they come out with something that looks similar to the Nex-7 in style with everything this has got in it.
Personally I am looking forward to using my Pentax and Minolta MD lenses on these cameras. Happy that 3rd party's like Samyang got the inside track on the camera in order to give photographers more lens choice because those Sony lenses are expensive!
Yea won't need the SLT sensor with the A7
Any idea what the difference between the LA-EA3 and new LA-EA4 adaptors would be?
A bit disappointed in this. It's not a Nex, its not really an Alpha, it looks most like an interchangeable RX-1 with everything I could hope for but its is the ugly cousin and they don't seem to be using the Cybershot brand for it either. Really wanting something that stays along the lines of the Nex-7 and for it to be identified as the Nex-7 successor. Or for there to be a proper Nex-9 Full Frame camera. This one is a Sony imaging Frankenstein
They are trying to cram every single persons want for the "perfect Sony camera" into these 2. I wonder if these FE lenses will even work on the other Nex's. You do get a mount adaptor with them though, Leica, Canon or Nikon. I want the A7 with the kit lens and I'll have a bag of manual lenses.
It practically looks like an RX-1 with an evf on top and interchangeable lens mount
I don't think the grip depth is enough and seriously sick of the futuristic camera designs of the past which is what this looks like it is going for. Will just have to wait till the end of the week to see what it is all about and whether or not I will get one or keep waiting.
I think they've managed to get every control dial you could ever need on there. I just really dislike its looks!
I believe in function over form as well but they could have made this better looking than it is. I could not complain about the looks on any of the NEX, RX or Alpha cameras and they are functional as well but this one just looks like a Frankenstein of those 3 brands. If it still does everything I need of a camera, is easy to attach manual lenses to and has great image quality I will get one. The looks will have to grow on me. Just grumbling really
