Yup! I have a decent handful of those. =P
I tend to agree with + Chris Dekter In all honesty, I can't see any massive advantages on the curved screen. Yes, it may work for pockets (is your current device really that uncomfortable?), and I'm guessing that the curve may help reduce screen reflections. Possibly a handy feature for one handed use. Ultimately though, it's not something that makes me want to rush out and buy. It's a novelty, something new to market in a competitive field. Meh. Show me the real grunt and power.
They're just trying to figure out how to implement the new bendy screen technology now. lol I can't say I have ever held my phone and thought to myself, gee it would be nice if I could just fold the screen a bit. =P
