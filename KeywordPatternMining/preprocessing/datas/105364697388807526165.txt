Screw that! I want to see Vettel and Kimi on the same team. Especially after Kimis "Did you get a drive-thru" to Vettel after the race yesterday
I'm not so sure. Vettel has gotten used to having a dedicated No2, and RB has always favored him. Pair him with anyone that actually gets to compete on equal terms, be it Alonso, Kimi or Webber for that matter, and you will soon see Golden Boy start crying to Horner. :-P
