Interesting note on the D610. I sent my D600 in for cleaning just before my warranty ran out. I mentioned the well known dust/oil sensor issue. When it came back...low and behold...the paperwork shows that they changed the shutter mechanism . I strongly suspect it may be the same mechanism from the new D610!!
I just saw a post the other day comparing them to the GoPro. Looks like the image quality is way better with the Sony.
