Unless Sony's made any changes to the dock that isn't the original Sony Dock. The original dock like I have has the USB-connector on the lower middle of the long side! Not that I care much where the connector is located, both works but be aware if you want the "real" DK26 Sony dock. Here's a pic of the original!
Yeah it is probably a good dock, but if someone wanted to real Sony dock, this isn't for them.
