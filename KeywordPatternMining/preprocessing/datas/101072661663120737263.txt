Hi Michael. I know a pro who's used the Canon Professional Service and rates it highly for both speed and value. I recently used Fixation for a couple of repairs. They provided quotes up front and did a great job. I decided not to go ahead with one repair and i collected the item and there was no charge. I did have to chase on progress on the repairs (they could have been a bit more proactive in contacting me) but I'd not hesitate in using them again. As an aside Fixation also had a fair amount of second hand Nikon and Canon stuff at good prices. All bodies had number of actuations and some had warranties. And to the comment about Nikon / Canon all I'll say (and this is the same for Mac / PC, Android / IOS etc.). They're just tools and toolsets, use what suits you and fits the way you want to work. Nobody asks about the camera when they see a photo. If it's a great shot, it's a great shot. It's all about the ideas
And if you're wondering the repairs were a 24-70 that the lens hood mount had come loose and the zoom had become sticky, a macro flash that the bulb had blown and an old 50mm which had stopped autofocussing after being out on a wet shoot (which ACB was due to attend as I remember). The 50mm was uneconomical to repair so is now manual focus ;-)
As a matter of interest what did they have to do to repair it?
