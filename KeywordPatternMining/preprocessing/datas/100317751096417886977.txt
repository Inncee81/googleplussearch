this is contrast detect AF and E-mount? so it's a Nex in an SLR body. So none of the advantages of an SLR or of the NEX lines and the limited lens selection of the NEX line. Is there a "release without lens setting" on this camera? We need this to mount third party manual lenses like we do with the rest of the NEX line. This is a little ... well actually a lot disappointing if this is the direction Sony is going with the SLR line.
