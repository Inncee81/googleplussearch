Dear Sir, This is to let you know how very terribly disappointed i'm, after just about a week of purchasing the Xperia Z(C6602). I have always been a Sony fan, be it TV, home theatre system or phone, I had trust in the brand and the quality of the products you got into the market. Even when i made our 3D LED TV purchase I insisted on a Sony, and when it was a home theatre system again Sony. In every word a very loyal customer. But now that trust in the product has been shattered. Its hasn't even been a week since I purchased my brand new Xperia Z and my phone went into a restart loop. And whats worse is the only solution I could find, required me to repair my device using Sony's PC companion (that doesn't even seem to work on the Mac) and loose all my data and wait hours while the s/w downloaded the files and to make matters worse that didn't work. Now I can't even step out without a phone, and what spare phones I have don't run on a micro sim. So I'm stuck until the phone starts. Not to mention the shame i'll have to face when I have to tell this to my colleagues and friends( After actually praising this product so much ) Seriously i didn't expect this out of a Sony product. And yeah i'm pissed 'cause I did not spend 34k to have additional headaches. If this is the quality of the product I get for my hard earned money, then please GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. So seriously, either fix this permanently or please give me my money back. There are load of other phones in the market I'll get at the price that I paid for this, and i could bet non of them would give such grave problems in a week. Thank you, Shalom Sam EMAIL : shalom-s@hotmail.com
+ Sony Xperia India @rachell- tried recovering the phone using PC companion on windows pc thrice. All three times it showed the update as successful. But once I turn on the phone, process crashed and the restart loop would begin.
Its so frustrating, I have already wasted my entire Sunday on this. And to think I paid so much for this!!
+ Sony Xperia and not to mention I cant even get in touch with anyone. My previous and only other spare phone does not run on a micro sim. So here i'm stuck
+ Sony Xperia @rachell- is there any way i can apply for a money back??
