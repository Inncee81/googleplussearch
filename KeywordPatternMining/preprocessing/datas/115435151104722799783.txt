This part of the World is gorgeous! And I'm including my part also. Northern California is as wonderful in beauty as Oregon. I'm waiting for our State of Jefferson to be born. Of course people will ruin whatever they manage but so far the forests are great. Don't let the loggers in or all you'll have is mud, slides, more insects, and more sunlight to burn up the creatures and flora of the area. Our area used to get over 100" of rain a year, but now if we get 20" we're doing good.
