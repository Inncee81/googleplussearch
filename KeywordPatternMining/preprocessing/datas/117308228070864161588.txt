Okay, that is awesome! I think I have also identified several locations! Looks like the highway along the right hand side is 87. The highway just visible in the bottom left is 85. The 85/87 interchange was actually just cut off below the frame. The bright white patch just to the left of 87 is Hillsdale Ave with Capitol Expressway being highlighted by the two orange patches on the other side of 87. Communication Hill is just north of the two orange patches. The Plant Shopping Center being the rectangular orange patch just north of Communication Hill near center along the right margin. The intersection of Curtner/Tully and Monterey Hwy is in the lower right corner of The Plant Shopping Center, touching the right frame. Following the 87 to the north you can see dark, diagonal rectangular patch near the Bay and that would be the San Jose International Airport.
Oh, and yes, I CAN see where I live too!
+ Peter Adams Thanks, I am also able to spot 280 and what I think is El Camino Real as well. Both of them running nearly parallel to each other and are near the top. Both going to the northwest before heading up. The brighter one is 280 and the fainter one being El Camino Real. If I'm not mistaken that is.
