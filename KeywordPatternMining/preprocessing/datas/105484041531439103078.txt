So you're famous in the physical world now too, eh? ;-)
Much better in some ways than my totally absurd SEO...
Darren, I did an "Unboxing" shoot when my Capture v2 (PRO) arrived if you're interested. I've been using the original for some time now, as well as their "Leash" strap replacement. I've been nothing but pleased with both of the Capture units, and the Leash has been a revelation of similar magnitude. The Capture doesn't specifically aim to dislodge BlackRapid from their well-earned roost, in fact the newer Pro-Plates attach using bolts that host D-Rings specifically designed to be compatible with that kind of sling strap. (The Leash is Peak Design's competitive strap entry.) The only thing I've been seriously looking to add is one of the Pentax-branded hand straps for the times the camera spends not clipped into the Capture. As for any question of "time to deploy" the camera, it is virtually the same with the Capture as with a sling strap. With some practice you can grab hold of the camera, push the release, and move into shooting position all using only one hand and with decent fluidity. Hope that helps!
Great shot and definitely worth sticking around long enough to get it. You do understand that the primary reason why Mainers tell people "Youh khan't ghet thareh frohm hereh" is to watch their heads explode, right?
