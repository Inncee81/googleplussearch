Do you have a link save me trawling xda?
N4 worst, washed out colour reproduction doesn't seem dynamic or contrasted, best is Z1, followed by the s2, the QX10 seems to have really struggled with the lens glare, haven't had it myself but will try to replicate against the Z1ï»¿ Edit: was the N4 in HDR? I've always found the N4 takes better pictures in HDR
I had the s2, wonderful phone still relevant after all this time, that is a good photo from the s2
I've seen cheap Chinese after market ones on ebay, this looks official Sony do you have a link?
TY will pick one up really don't like using the flaps and compromising the waterproof feature
On the macros the colour reproduction is completely different on each photo,which one more realistically represents the actual subject?
TBH nothing really excites me about the LG G2, it seems like a Samsung copy with an off the wall feature (back controls) to show separation and innovation
I`m on the fence over the SW2, my geeky side is talking me into it........im sure the wife with bring me back to earth
Already pre ordered the Z1 and got the cybershot with it
Seems to be trying too do too much, would prefer a smart watch to be a companion to my phone (if im missing the point of the omate forgive me i haven't researched it in depth) same reason im not interested in the gear.....too much going on
I think the SW2 is IP 57 off the top of my head, will check Companion as compliments my phone rather than trying to replace it. You could say limited or say that Sony is trying to keep it simple to extend battery life, I will concur im not struck on the SW2 design im going to check out omates website now
I too opted for the Z1 and don't think i will regret it
