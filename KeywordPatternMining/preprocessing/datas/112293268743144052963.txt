Season 1 with the ninth Doctor is what hooked me. And no doubt it has now hooked + Cali Lewis as well.
+ Ernest W All of them.
I've been trying to figure out a purpose for a curved screen ever since I first heard of them. Still got nothing...
Because they are cats, and cats don't give a shit.
+ Gary White The name is Cheesus Christ, is delicious on a pizza, and inappropriate to you is God damned hysterical to me. DEAL WITH IT!!!
I want that to replace every hourglass, busy symbol everywhere! Time flies when you're watching Cali.
Remember that question + John Pozadzides posted about what people would do if God told them to do it? Apparently they consider sending him ass cancer acceptable.... What a shitty thing to send someone. DO NOT OPEN THAT BOX!!!
