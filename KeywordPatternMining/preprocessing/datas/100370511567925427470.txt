Well for that matter so is Sarah McLachlan (Hot and talented)! And she's no myth. Oh and don't forget Rush too (best drummer in the known universe). So I don't think Canada is a myth, is not as perfect as some people claim it might be.
When Beeber is in the news for doing something stupid we must remind the world that he is Canadian so it doesn't look bad for us in the U.S.
