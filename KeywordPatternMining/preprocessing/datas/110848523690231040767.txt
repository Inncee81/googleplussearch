I have no idea what my first CD purchase was, but the first one I remember was Marilyn Manson - Antichrist Superstar. I got it the day it came out. For some reason we got out of school early that day and I remember going straight to the local shop where I ended up buying a good number of my fave albums and picking it up, running home and playing it on repeat for hours.
