I think it had been better if they built in this functions in a widget we could have on our home screens instead of an launcher, in that case we could use our favorit launcher for the rest
If the curve is large enough it maybe be easier to use a large screen with one hand
+ Stefan Svartling true I don't think the curve can be large enough to make any difference
In the way of learning both Swiftkey and Swype needs time to learn your type of writing when i test keybords i always give them a month so they get a fair chance to show their strength. How good has swype been to predict next word or learn phrase?
I try Swype now, only thing I don't like is the change between m languages
+ Stefan Svartling yes, i think it takes a few days to learn
After a few days with Swype I like it a lot but some things are hard to learn. I hit for example h to get a + but got an ) instead
+ Stefan Svartling yes, but I had to look every time yet and for example i haven't found : and _ without go to the 123 part I learn but I think it takes lot of time to I be as fast as with swiftkey but the swipe is amazing fast and easy, I like Swype and think I stay with it
I think one of their biggest mistake is that they brand android so hard with sense, it make many customers to don't like the devices even if hardware and build quality are good
