"A Glock 26 or an LCP cannot stop an AR-15" I would not be trying to stop the AR, I would be stopping the human operating it. Any handgun caliber round could do that job.
as for point 2, I feel it's unfortunate that our society ignores the other 12,000 homicides a year and only worries about the few tragedies that gain national attention. Are not a majority of those homicides committed by criminals, and past surveys have shown 80% of the weapons used by criminals come from friends/family or from illegal/street sources?
