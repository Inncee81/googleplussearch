Very interesting. I think there needs to be an overall shift in thinking about the sacrifices needed to have children. Where does the notion that women have to give up their careers to have children even come from? I think society has led women to believe to be a "good" mother you have to stay home. I actually believe in corporate America at least, most employers will work with a valuable employee to find a good work/life balance. I think professional women have been brainwashed to think they have to choose. Now, for lower to middle income families, it probably comes down to child care costs. THATS what needs to change to get more women back in the work force. When the cost of childcare costs as much or more than a woman's salary, then of course she's going to stay home. So, change the perception that stay at home moms are better moms, decrease the salary disparity between men and women AND make childcare more affordable then I think more women will stay in the work force.
Yes agreed. Part-time in most professional jobs is not common and it would be nice to feel like there were more options than to just "lean out" of the work force. I would add these options should also be readily available for the Dads too Fathers get very little attention in this discussion but their circumstances and expectations need to be adjusted too.
