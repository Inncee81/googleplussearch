+ Stefan Svartling It's unlimited number of photos, but you only have 5 GB storage in total.
+ Stefan Svartling No, the total size is 5 GB for all images.
Actually it seems like Sony thinks US is the least important market as reported today:
64-bit is not a small thing to not mention, and they also have the best camera on the market. The iPhone 5s is totally okay for another year.
+ Stefan Svartling it's actually a nice performance boost and doesn't drain batteries nearly as much as a screen do anyway
+ Micah Howe yes, it's a perfect example of how megapixels are not very important. The great thing with the Sony Z1 is the water proofing, but the actual camera is better on iPhone 5s. Plus for a photographer there are infinitely more good photo apps available on IOS. A similar case can be found with DSLR cameras. I recently moved away from all my expensive Canon gear and now only shoot with my Sony NEX system. And many famous photographers are doing the same right now.
+ Stefan Svartling Sure, but no offense, that's just your personal opinion and you haven't tried the iPhone 5s. Sure, it has a larger sensor but also larger resolution, which makes it actually not much better. I've compared photos myself, but I'm also pretty sure you can't find a proper comparisation on the net where they say that the Z1 is superior. Here's a good explaination of the different cameras: Since photography is often about post-processing, you want good software and sharp images. The Z1 have a problem with unsharp edges and Android have a problem of not very good photo apps. It's still an awesome phone and a great camera, and a great value for the money. Just don't want to see the new camera in IPhone 5s be treated unfair because of some numbers in specs.
I don't have one personally but we do have them at the office. Among other things, we make apps for IOS and Android, so have many of the popular phones and tablets within reach.
(Can add that the iPhone 5S suffered from the same problem with yellowish screen like other first batch iPhones have had before it)
+ Stefan Svartling there are lots of images in the ljnk above
+ Stefan Svartling Ok, well, then it's good that there are in-depth articles that can tell the facts for those who cannot see it.
+ Stefan Svartling No reason. You clearly know more about the subject than anyone else. I'm happy that you enjoy your camera!
+ Robert Sørensen The best camera is the one you brought with you, as the saying goes. I think the Z1 have a great camera that most people can be very happy with. Sure, it does some heavy post-processing that is much better to do in software afterwards, but most users don't care about that and only see the result as it looks like "raw". The 20mp mode seems to be off as standard, which is also a wise choice considering how much space it will take up on disc when most people only want to post low-res to Instagram or Facebook anyway. There's a lot of noise in such high-res images too. What I really think that the Z1 does good, which is not mentioned in most reviews, is that it's water-proof. That's a consumer friendly function if anything and a lot of fun! The only reason I discuss the camera is when I read that it's superior to the iPhone 5S camera. It's not. It does some things better but it's not an argument in a discussing of what phone to get. Apple is not at all "behind" the competition when it comes to the camera.
It does not take DSLR quality photos. You'd need the new QX10 attached to even come close.
