Well new camera and switch to 64bit on top of new iOS7, fingerprint scanner and colours is actually more then I expected from a "s" release. I do expect iPhone 6 to sport a somewhat different look, but I don't really see why the iPhone needs a redesign. Unless it's to accomodate a larger screen. The one thing I have been looking at Android for is advanced rules for the behaviour with apps like "Tasker". And Winphone has the Nokias with awesome cameras. But nothing of that is even close to making me switch.
True + Stefan Svartling I don't really agree with the closed source way of Apple or some of their business practices. But their polished "software and hardware tailored for each other as a single artefact"-approach won me over with an dated old G4 mac when I was running a modern 64bit Ubunty machine I built from parts some years back. I love FOSS but have to give Apple that they might be the one company who actually puts the control a vendor have over proprietary software to good use in order to make a better product for the end user.
+ Stefan Svartling Good to know If i ever make the switch
