Went in to my local T-mo store this weekend and bought a Note 3. While checking out, I asked if the S4 or HTC One was the better seller. She said they hardly sell the One and most people come in for the S4 or iPhone 4. She said the One sold well during the first week, but there were many returns due to quality issues. When I tried the One, it just wasn't enough to warrant the full price.
