Nexus 5 is on the list... Last one and that is me done for 2013.
+ Stefan Svartling I do this every year. Just love tech.
+ Stefan Svartling have phones but no food ha ha.
That echoes my thoughts...all apps and media we consume designed for flat screens...to my mind the Round is experimentation at its finest.

I own all 3 and have been most impressed by the tablet. With the phones I have had issues which culminated in the z being sold and the z1 exchanged 3 times before I had a device that functioned as advertised. Given all of this still think Sony have done a stellar job in making themselves and real contender in the Android space. Looking forward to 2014
