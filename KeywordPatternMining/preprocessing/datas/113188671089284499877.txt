Ha! Sounds like when Schumacher managed to place third last year in his incredibly unreliable car and had no idea he made it to the podium.
Beautiful. Now tell me you took these pictures with Glass and I'll really be impressed! ;)
I hope the rumors of Kimi going to Ferrari are true. Can you imagine the fights he'll have with Alonso? You won't even need races to have an entertaining season.
