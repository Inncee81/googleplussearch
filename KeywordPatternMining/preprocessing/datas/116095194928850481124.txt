I don't agree with the settlement for one simple reason. You, as an artist, were already paid to produce a piece of art that would be displayed publicly. If you were paid for all to see it, why should anyone continue to pay you to continue to see it? Photographs are nothing more than sharing the locations, and it is like Aaron Nace says, it's derivative art. Do I have to pay now for taking an image of the Statue of Liberty? This is not the same as stealing a photo, specially when you haven't given permission for the photo to be used in any other way or place. This sculpture is in the public eye. I think it's a bunch of cow dookie. He was already paid to share the image with the world.
I don't know, to me it's a very grey area, but not worthy of settling for that amount. The US Postal Service has for years used images to make stamps, do they now have to go back in time and settle for each one... that's why some days I just can't stand lawyers.
So maybe Fredrick should pay Joseph Strauss for that Golden Gate bridge image if it makes him any money? that's some ......
On Wedding Photography and mirrorless >> So as serious amateurs or professionals, you know the limitations of APS-C and Micro 4/3 versus Full Frame, especially in Wedding photography. Personally, no camera or lens system will make wedding photos more or less creative, but there are definite advantages to Full frame. Also, if the photographer has a great portfolio, I don't care what camera he/she uses so long as they deliver on the promise.
