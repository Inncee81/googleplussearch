Just saw this at Best Buy today, interesting device I like the fact it is compact and versatile.
You just added another option for me, I was all set on getting the new HDR-30AS Action cam now I'm torn! Thanks...
That's the issue outdoor activities but I would like to have good sound.
I'm not sure how rugged this would be outdoors...
Yeah I will probably get the new SA HDR-30AS I think it would be a better choice for what I want it for. Good to have options though!
