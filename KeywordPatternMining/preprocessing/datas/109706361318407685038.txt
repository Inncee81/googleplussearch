#waffle , it's nice, but... Lacking... Flower shots really need to be spectacular IMO to be saved, just because they're so common, and yet this one is technically very good, so I can't really make up my mind.
#delete2 + Jack Johnson may be speaking of the balance, the composition is heavy on our left (read: too much of the tractor is on that side). It should be heavier on the right, since the tractor is pointing to the left, it gives it space to "move."
#delete2 , really lovely and really close, but there is no focal point as Krish said, there's this lamp post in the middle, but some buildings that have the color directing your eye towards them, then theres that cool building on the left, and there's a nice little green slightly to the right of the middle... You just needed to move your camera here I think, but your processing is spot on. Theres a really blurry tree to the left of the foreground tree, which is a bit weird, but would have been excusable if the composition were stronger.
