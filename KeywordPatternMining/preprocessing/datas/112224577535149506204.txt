I this situation, cable lock is the way to go. Cable theft alarm is not the way to go because when the cable is unplugged, the alarm comes on, then the other person obviously plugs it back in, but in ChargePoint and Blink stations, the charging has stopped! Just leave an intimidating sign saying "DO NOT UNPLUG, YOU ARE ON CAMERA"
