I concur with + Blake Zimmerman . This just isn't for the likes of us, it's for the likes of new moms with new DSLRs hoping to capture their kids growing up. This is perfect for them, because they can now shoot RAW and reap the benefits without the complication it came with before. From a populist point of view, it's a great thing. As a semi-pro married to a pro, this isn't a factor, not even with regards to competition.
