Thank you + Davide De Benedictis . GH3 looking very promising. Still don't know if I could live without zoomability when shooting macro (or in general without a flip CC filter). Old habits die hard. I wonder what the result would be if you put a wet wide converter in front of the 60 or 45mm macro lens, to get some wider shots...
Nice job! How did you screw up your shots? They look pretty good to me.
+ Davide De Benedictis You made a great job of "fixing" it. Awesome job really for your first cave shoot. Looking forward to the next one.
Nice to see some competition in this sector! I'd be getting my Allen key out straight away and getting those legs off for a nice low POV.
Now we need his GH3 housing, with all bells and whistles.
We see them all the time at Racha Yai.
Millions of them. Can't move for them on some days.
I forgot the wink. Seen the odd cuttlefish there though.
I thought Rome was hot? Looking forward to the video.
Wow, congratulations to them. Looking forward to seeing the whole film somewhere.
+ Davide DiBi Are you asking what software to use? If so, PC or Mac? Or are you asking about general method?
+ Davide DiBi Big respect for achieving this quality of video from such depth. The GH2 does a really good job here.
Hi + Davide DiBi , great to see you here.
