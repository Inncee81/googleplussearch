It fits 16 games in mine.you have to take out the memory card holder piece & then you can put a game in that piece. I love this game holder, I only have 16 games & it holds them perfectly..
I know right, I have some what of nails on my fingers & the games fit so tight, that it's like so hard to get the games out. I have both dsi & 3ds games in my case & there both equally hard to get out but I like how u can store a lot of games cuz b4 I got this I had to carry 4 little cases that only had 4 games each. It was a nightmare.
