I gave up on cnet a few years ago. It was pretty obvious they didn't know what they were talking about when it came to android. Now I tend to stick with dedicated news sites for the subject at hand. Sites that encompass many subjects tend to know the basics (or just enough) about each various topic. Edit: Anandtech seems to be the exception to this so far. They are very knowledgeable at many tech subjects.
Soon you will only be able to use Samsung devices with Samsung products/services/software/codecs/etc... (source: Samsung gear)
+ Tom anMoney I was being sarcastic, trying to imply that Samsung would eventually start making their own codecs (& anything else you could think of) that you would be forced to use on their devices. Basically, I think that the Samsung Gear being locked to only Samsung devices is stupid!
+ Tom anMoney from what I've read, it will only be opened up to other Samsung devices. Time will tell.
