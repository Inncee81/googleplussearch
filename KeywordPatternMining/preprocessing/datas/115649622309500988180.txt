About damn time. Those buttons at the top of the Store's home screen (although stylish) matched nothing else within the Android style guide. [EDIT] I see that they're keeping them, and the drawer is just for options that should be in the action bar or spill menu. Oh well.
Google has had more leaks than a barbed-wire canoe with the Nexus 5. We (presumably) know everything about it now, so either Google knows that we know and doesn't care, or there is a different reason for the delay. The recent pictures of a best-buy Nexus 5 display suggest that the phone is ready to go. I'm thinking that Google may be delaying the announcement so as to get the Nexus 10 (or another device) out the door at the same time. There's been very little info leaked about the new tablet. (I acknowledge that this is all conjecture on my part, and is clearly going against the point of the post.)
