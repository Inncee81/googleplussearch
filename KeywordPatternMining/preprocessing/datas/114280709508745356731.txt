+ Scott Fitzgerald I left a comment on that post about the inclusion on Engage! by + Brian Solis of a "template" for those who need something now, at least as a stopgap: it's a set of "Top 10 Guidelines for Social Media Participation" provided by + Todd Defren "for public dissemination and motivation". I use it as a discussion starter for companies to develop their own, company-appropriate, culturally-appropriate policies.
Good article, a bit of "we'll all be rooned, said Hanrahan" but including at least one quote with a dollop of speculative optimism about it all settling down sometime in the future. A counter-balance to social media evangelism. Possibly paralysis-inducing for any CEO or board member thinking about getting their firm seriously into social media engagement. Disappointingly, implicitly dismissive about the extraordinary turnaround by Dell, now world leaders in handling social business engagement. Social media consultants probably hope their prospects do not read the SMH.
True. What I recommend - nothing new about this but new to some business owners I talk to and some just won't take the plunge - is to aim to be so much a part of the conversation (as real people, cf Zappos, Dell) that you can have a reasonable expectation that the community will speak up for you when and if the trolls invade. Takes time and resources, but beats trying to jump in, relatively unknown, once the stuff starts to hit the fan.
