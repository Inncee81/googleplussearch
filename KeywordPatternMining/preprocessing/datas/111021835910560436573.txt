can you share the full sphere + Josh Jett ?
sure + Josh Jett . No Problem I gonna try it by myself with my son. I only was interested in which position your daughter lays in front of you
when i take sphere with a lot of people i also try to take 3 shots(middle, up and down) where the people stand, where no people are i use my normal technique to do first middle shots, then up and then down and at the end top and bottom. But in this case i often get a bad result in stiching afterwards. In some cases i have black areas where no pictures seems to be taken, but i took all "blue dots" before...
you are right + Josh Jett . I found time to try it in my lunchtime today. i made 3 photospheres with 3 different techniques): 1. turn my phone around my body like described in the tutorial from + Erica Griffin https://plus.google.com/111021835910560436573/posts/GBSVMM4v4cF 2. circle my body around my phone like you described in your post 3. turn my phone around my body but take 3 pictures in a row up and down The result were 3 nearly identical spheres... the second sphere wasn't not as good stiched as sphere 1 and 3 but i think that is because i am not in training with your technique... Like you described you have to take the pictures really slow and be aware of the point you are standing. The software is going to make the best of what you photograph
