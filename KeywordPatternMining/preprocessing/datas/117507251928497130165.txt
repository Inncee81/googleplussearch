Hi Tommy! This is the one I would like a print of (5x10). So nice of you to offer, though I was totally happy to spare my 99 cents! I could totally see this hanging in my room somewhere as a motivational image. Aspiring traveler here :). All of your work is beautiful and I look forward to seeing more. Cheers!
