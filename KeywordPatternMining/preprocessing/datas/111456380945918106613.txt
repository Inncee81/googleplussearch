+ Xoa Gray that's not what they're doing. You have to leave that feedback on your own, from your Google account. All this feature does is pop your comment to the forefront if one of your Google+ friends is looking at the same product. Say, for instance, I was in the market for a TV, and you had just bought one and made a review. When I'm looking at TVs on Google Shop, your comment would pop to the front on that one TV, because I'm friends with you.
