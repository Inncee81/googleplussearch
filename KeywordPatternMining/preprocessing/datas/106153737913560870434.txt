+ Suzanne Stewart maybe is a mistranslation, there is no Nichiren temple in Japan that says so, the inscriptions in the temples says: "The Buddha of True Cause" it is different than the "true Buddha" Quoting wikipedia: "In Nichiren Shoshu Nichiren is revered as 'The Buddha of True Cause' because, they believe, he revealed the 'cause' of Buddhahood: chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. Whereas Shakyamuni is seen as 'The Buddha of True Effect' as he only revealed the 'effect' of Buddhahood. This is based on the passage in Chapter 16 of the Lotus Sutra that reads: "Originally I [Shakyamuni Buddha] practiced the bodhisattva way, and the life that I acquired then has yet to come to an end" Nichiren Shoshu, and also Soka Gakkai, interpret the passage to mean that Shakyamuni must have practiced something to attain Buddhahood, but in the Lotus Sutra he did not reveal what that practice was. Whereas Nichiren taught the daimoku, Nam(u)-myoho-renge-kyo, which leads all beings to Buddhahood. Soka Gakkai and Nichiren Shoshu conclude that it was because of the daimoku that Shakyamuni attained Buddhahood in the remote past. SGI Literature explains further that if Shakyamuni is understood to have started his Buddhist practice at certain point in time - by being a bodhisattva - then this leads to the contradiction that he cannot be called an eternal Buddha, therefore the only explanation is that Shakyamuni was a Buddha who practiced as Bodhisattva: “His true identity is that of a Buddha exerting himself at the initial stage of Buddhist practice, embodying the oneness of cause and effect. Such a figure had never before been known in the history of Buddhism”
