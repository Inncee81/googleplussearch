Wow.. this is ridiculous. Just buy a flipping camera will ya?
+ David Henderson , + Jon Bauerle Yes they can, I will not do the research for you but if you choose to do so then you would see just how stupid the posted setup is. Samsung makes some brilliant products in this area.
+ David Henderson im not here to prove anything to you nor am I going to research better options for you. I am saying that I've run across several devices that are compact and designed to do just this but don't have readily available links for you. It's clear that you have yet to do any research yourself. That being said, and the fact you're un knowingly sticking to your guns in that "nothing out there is better than this" makes you ignorant and no further time will be wasted on you. Good day sir.
