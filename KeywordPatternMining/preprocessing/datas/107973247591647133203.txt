How can you post such utter rubbish + Sony Xperia ? The camera is mediocre at best. In un-natural light it's awful. So much noise and blur. Over processing seems to also be an issue. People, do not buy this phone for its camera. You, like me, will be disappointed.

Hi Rachel, unless there are perfect natural daylight conditions there is a lot of noise, blur due to what I assume post processing. As mentioned, I have two other handsets and they both take better pictures it almost all circumstances. I've done some comparisons on my G+ page. Are Sony working on any software updates for the camera as I'm considering returning the device as it's still in the 14 day cooling off period. Thanks.
