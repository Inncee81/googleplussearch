When you want to know the day or date of a particular holiday, just ask Google. For example, let's say you want to know what day of the week Halloween falls on this year. Tap the microphone on the Google Search app and ask, "When is Halloween?" You'll hear the answer spoken back to you and you'll see the answer at the top of the search results. In this case, Halloween is on a Thursday. You can also search for some of those more obscure holidays, like National Mole Day. Guess you'd better start planning your brilliant costume soon...or if you're more interested in celebrating Mole Day, searching for your chemistry set! Note that many holidays are regionally specific, so you may see different holidays depending on your location settings. #searchtips #googlesearch
