If you were to buy an A7(R), the next question is lenses. With the RX1(R), the next question is; "what do I want to photograph right now?" #RX1 #Sony #Camera #A7

One final thought; the A7 or A7R debate is not just about the camera bodies; it's about lenses. In fact, it's arguably more about lenses than bodies. There's a chance that any non-FE lenses (e.g. Leica) on the A7R 36Mp sensor may be closer to the 24Mp sensor (A7) than one may expect: if the RF lens has a resolution of 100 lines per mm, it can only resolve up to about 28Mp. These rangefinder lenses were never designed to be used with 36MP sensors (and their output will vary). Another spanner in the works? Sony is infamous for their lack of E-mount lenses, and unless there is a good spread of FE lenses, perhaps the A7 is the smarter buy?
+ Aaron Choi thanks! Will have a read shortly.
New camera? Money is the main factor behind this decision. If I look at it objectively as a tool.... I don't need it. Subjectively as a gadget with great specs and a few extra performance features... I want it. That's the difference ;) #A7R #Sony #Cameras
Moved the entry into the "Reviews/Gear" section of my site ;)
Review of the A7 and A7R cameras by The Camera Store
Due to a Typhoon, Tokyo is "not on schedule". However, I think Sony will be with their A7/A7R announcement ;) #tokyo #typhoon #A7 #A7R #Sony #RX1
+ Bruce Levin Thanks for the drink!
Adding the double-rainbow to the RX1 folder... taken without any filters (originally I had a polarising filter, but removed it due to loss of the strength of the rainbow). #tokyo #rainbow #clouds
Does anyone know what maps are used in Whatsapp on Windows Phone 8? They are much better for Japan than the built in map content, and have really flummoxed me.
+ Joel Jorge Gaviola OK; but how can I get that to display in a separate map? I don't see any decent Google Maps apps for Windows Phone 8.
+ Ruben Quadros I have, and it seems to do some really weird flickering between satellite and map view
+ Steffen Müller so how can I have this as my own map?
+ Steffen Müller No problem. I can't here, because they don't have coverage (Japan).
+ Aaron Choi well, this was almost sunset here in Tokyo - usually it's impossible to see Fuji from Tokyo. Only on the crispest of Winter's days can we spot him. I'll be sure to get a snap of the snow-cap ;)
I've still not been up there yet, but this is Tokyo Sky Tree from a distance of 6.1km...
The River of Heaven
A few cloud & beach photos added to the RX1 album
+ Mikhail Kornienko thank you! It was very relaxing... I am still adjusting back to life in Tokyo
Can anyone tell me if this giant hermit crab I spotted in Taketomi, Okinawa, is Coenobita cavipes? Full write-up:
+ Shawn Miller I should have put my can of orion next to it for scale, but I didn't really want to pester him/her. Easily the size of two larger cans
+ Shawn Miller could be _Turbo_maramortus_ as it was rather pearlescent...
Does anyone have any idea why my NEXUS 7 might say that "device doesn't exist" in the PA OTA?
+ kev cunningham oh OK, thanks! Just by chance that I decided to turn on my NEXUS-7 after a couple of weeks. It seems quite slow, so I wanted to update it from whatever beta I am on.
Updated the RX1 album with some recent pictures
+ Chris Handley Hi Chris, I'd be more than happy to show even more photos, and answer any questions over a pint or two! Okinawa's an interesting place, and I know it quite well now. I don't really rate Naha, but there are some very nice places throughout the island chain.
Thanks, + Aaron Choi I really wanted to do something a little different with the holiday series. It's been a while since I posted (as I didn't (want to) have internet access), so I fancied something special. It's part of my "photo-journal" category, which I assign to a series of photos, usually from a trip or place, and is more of a diary than a daily shot. It's all part of a bigger plan ;)
Managed to take a (fully manual) photo of a butterfly as it flew by me - details in the post

On the Sunday, we headed south to Nara. All photos on the Sunday were taken with my RX1, as the rain put me off lugging around more than I had to.
Saw this little guy (5mm) on the steps
It's that Tamron 90mm, which does do macro - focussing is all manual, so it's pretty hard to do when handheld like this with a 90mm (135mm in FF) lens.
+ Mikhail Kornienko the EXIF is there, though the aperture may have been more like f/4... I'm not sure as I have to manually record it.
+ Mikhail Kornienko Hell, it could have been f/8! This spider was so small. I had to use the flash otherwise ISO would have been crasy; you can see the flash in his eyes. And yes you're correct that I need to vacuum the stairs tonight ;)
+ Mikhail Kornienko Yeah... I went downstairs and saw him this morning. He literally is about 3mm in size, max. I grabbed my NEX-7 and but the lens to maximum macro (1:1) and had to stop the lens down, otherwise the DoF at f/2.8 is razor thin and I would only get a few hairs in focus. It's somewhere between f/4 and f/8... when looking through the EVF it was black, so I popped up the flash and set speed to 1/160. The resultant file is from a RAW, and is roughly a 100% crop from the 24MP original.
A weekend in the Kinki Region [Google+ Gallery]
+ Hikari Takahara please do! I hope you enjoy the ride ^^ You can follow the journey on my blog, too. It starts here: www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/a-weekend-in-the-kinki-region-tokyo-to-kyoto
A weekend in the Kinki Region - Kyoto
+ Chris Handley Thank you for such kind words. The view through the temple was taken with the RX1; its dynamic range really allowed me to pull out the shadows in the foreground.
This little guy must have been around 2mm long... #spider #macro #NEX7
Fully manual; Tamron SP 90/2.8. I did have the Sony SEL30F35 and though it's actually a really, really good lens, having to get to ~1cm for 1:1 photos can prove tricky with anything alive I went out with it today and took some more photos; will post results soon.
+ Aaron Choi yeah me too, that's why I bought it ;)
+ Aaron Choi Yes! And, apparently Zeiss are releasing a 50mm Macro for E-mount... You could look into a screw on filter, or Kenko extension tubes for your current lenses. They seem to work well
+ Aaron Choi Yeah extension tubes lose a stop or two I believe, so that's where a flash comes in handy. I am very much still learning how to do all of this
A weekend in the Kinki Region - Tokyo to Kyoto #Tokyo #kyoto #japan #kinki #RX1 #NEX7
Thanks for the comment + Chris Handley I'm very much still enjoying the RX1! I took the RX1 and the NEX-7 with a couple of primes to Kyoto. On the final day I just took the RX1 - it's so small! Back in HK? How was the UK?
Sounds quite refreshing! Japan's cooled down a touch after a few rainy days, so it's comfortable now. The RX1 really suits both what I shoot and how I like to shoot. Of course, it's not perfect, but every time I review a photo it brings a smile to my face. I'm away from next Monday until 12 Sept, so give me a shout sometime.

I thought this article may be helpful to those with NEX cameras. The buttons on the back wheel stopped working, and the edges around the screen looked awful (the black layer was apparently scratching off). I wrote the article in the hope that if someone else experiences these issues, they may be able to find a solution a little faster than I.

Judging by its MTF curve (more of a straight line, really) the price of the 55/1,8 might well be justified. Again, let's compare the entire kit to what Leica have on offer...
I agree. We need to continue to push [our] boundaries in order to make progress. There are many things in the world which are far too expensive, but after a while, they trickle down to us mere mortals
