I hear of Amazon doing that a lot. I am never lucky enough to have it happen to me but a friend of mine got a duplicate ordered and called to get a label to return it and they told him to keep it. His item was only worth about 12 bucks. I wonder what they would say about doing that with a $200 SSD.
I got the extra item from my friend so it worked out for me. I just really want it to happen when I order something expensive once.
