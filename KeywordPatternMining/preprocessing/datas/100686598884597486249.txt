Great review + Gordon Laing ! I'd suggest that some of the choices about lens speed might also be to do with getting people using the Sony LA-E4 ( ) with fully-fledged Alpha mount glass. There'd be little value in going for a DT lens, but one of the Alpha Zeiss or G-lenses or the SAL75300 would work a treat with that adapter and the Alpha 7/7R bodies, and probably let you get down to the F1.4 range in some of the wider lenses.
