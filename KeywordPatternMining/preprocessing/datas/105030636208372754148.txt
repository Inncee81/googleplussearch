Hey thanks for the comments on my photo + Blunty - DigiDIRECT it's cool to see it in one of your videos. I was fully aware of the awkward elbow but, as in your video, I also used a make shift backdrop and was sat on my bedroom floor for the shot. I couldn't move the camera or myself back any further and it just didn't work in landscape orientation. Restrictions breed creativity as they say though. Or at least it makes you take dorky pictures of yourself with a camera on your head. ;)
