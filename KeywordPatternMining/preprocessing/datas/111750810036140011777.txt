Loving the clean look of the Stereo amp! Noticed it has XLR inputs too which is bad ass for studio monitor hook ups. I want one now!
+ vn Sakura its Sony's portable bluetooth speaker. Its bigger than most handheld ones but its was designed to compete with Boses Soundlink. Its 20 watts when plugged in via ac adapter then its also rechargeable. Cuts power in half on battery power but gets great life and audio is very clean and enjoyable. I like it ; )
