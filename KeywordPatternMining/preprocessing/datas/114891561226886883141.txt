Hey Rufat, yeah I reproduced the bugs a few times. I'm on a Nexus 4 running 4.3 and the bugs seemed to happen most when trying to go into general settings (but after going through other settings rapidly). That's where the freezes happened most. I was pretty heavy on my testing though but got quite a few weird things going on. Happy to share them with you and help out.
