Not when you compare to the upcoming Acer 11" Haswell Chromebook that's rumored to retail for $299 or less.
+ Stefan Svartling agreed. The build quality on this looks to be better than what we've seen so far for Chromebooks.

Come on Google, don't fuck this up! Please order 5-10m devices for launch.
Any signs of on if Google will finally make wishlists shareable or the ability to gift apps?
+ Artem Russakovskii can we get a rumor of the day? Something to hold us over.
+ Peter Doughman can we wait for Google to actually announce a date before we start speculating about any "delays"?
Will this experience include full app & settings backup?
I think it's misdirection like what they did with the new Nexus 7. With everyone chasing Nexus 7 news & leaks, no one really picked up on the Chromecast & that ended up stealing the show.
I hope Google's learned their lessons from last year's N4 launch & make sure to have 5-10m units available.
Now if you compare this press imagine to the Telus images leaked earlier, it clearly looks like the Telus imagines were shopped.
This screams Photoshop. The wallpaper alone doesn't look like a "typical" Nexus wallpaper. Also, if the Moto X doesn't have a carrier boot image, why would the next Nexus?
Other then the Verizon Galaxy Nexus, which had the Verizon logo on the back of the device, Nexus devices have traditionally been carrier branding free. This looks more like a press imagine for their product page & not an actual splash screen like the article suggests.
Telus also "branded" the Nexus 4 on their product page, & as far as I can tell, there wasn't a branded splash page.
+ Nathan L since the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus devices have been pentaband. Assuming the Nexus 5 is too, you'll be able to use it on all Canadian carriers except for Public Mobile.
Recognize the timing everyone. Apple's scheduled to release their earnings report on Oct. 28 so their carefully planting these "reports" so analysts reduces their expectations only for Apple to beat the lowered expectation. Remember Apple doesn't breakdown their iPhone sales numbers by model so we'll never know how poorly the 5c's doing. The number to pay attention to is their gross margins. Its been falling sharply over the last few quarters. If that shows signs of slowing, then the 5c's doing the job it was designed for (protecting profit margins).
