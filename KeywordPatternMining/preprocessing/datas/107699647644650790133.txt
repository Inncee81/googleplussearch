It's a tough choice + Tommy Clark I think I will be sticking with my canon 5d mark iii for a while, when + Trey Ratcliff did his Photowalk in Brisbane I was along side him when we both were taking photos of the water and light show. Once I got back home I compared my photos ( canon 5d mark iii with a zeiss 50mm f2 lens ) with Treys photo (sony nex 7 ) and the canon 5d mark iii won hands down for quality and overall look.
That truly is a taste of heaven, well done
Beautiful capture + Tommy Clark the feeling of warmth in the grass makes want to sit there and watch the world go by. I think your words work perfectly with your photo, do you write much poetry ?
I love this image so much, it reminds me of my favorite movie Gladiator
Beautiful colours, I love how the grass has a dreamy look to it.
+ Tommy Clark one of you best shots in my eyes, you truly have a way with words that we can all learn from . A very wise man indeed.
I have been thinking of joining flickr, in you honest option would you recommend it ?
So beautiful the sun really brings out the detail. The way you write about these image is truly inspiring. I wish I had your gift.
Another great capture
Truly amazing + Tommy Clark I think hands down one of your best photos to have taken, I love the colours and warmth of the photo, well done
