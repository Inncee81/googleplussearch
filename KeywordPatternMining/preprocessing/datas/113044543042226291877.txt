For sure there will be people switching from a MFT camera to these new Sony mirrorless camera's. But not everyone needs a full frame camera. MFT camera will still be a good choice for people who want to have a compact system. And I agree with + Neil Howard that lens sizes will be an isue. The Sony camera's itself will be compact but the lenses will still be big. For every camera system there will be a market. It is up to the user to choose a system that suits his or her needs. I think it is more likely that DSLR users will switch to these new camera's then MFT users.
