They don't even have Devices in Singapore yet. And Singapore was one of the first 3 countries where the Nexus One was available (with HK and USA). Nothing since....

+ Lawrence Brooksher The Samsung Gear is locked to only one Samsung device and that's the Note 3. It's clearly a marketing decision to sell them as a pair. I have no doubt it will be opened up fairly soon.
+ Lawrence Brooksher Yeah, that's what they are saying now, but I would be surprised if they didn't open it up universally. If the sales are blockbuster, though, they will probably keep it to themselves, but somehow I doubt that would be the case.
+ Francisco Sumohano Chibr√°s What I don't get about the new white status bar is how are they going to indicate if you are connected to Google services. Before, the icons were white if not connected and then turned green/blue once connected. Now they have to come up with something else.
+ Artem Russakovskii Ok, thanks. I wonder if this won't cause outdoors visibility problems .
