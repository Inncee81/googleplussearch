I'd rather have the larger sensor size than the Z, I honestly don't care about the difference in MP, and neither should most people.
+ Simone Ferro I'd call it "Ugh, damn engineers! Now we've gotta be careful or we'll get sued for false advertising!" The firmware lowers the resolution of the output by oversampling. This is kind of to cameras what Retina is to MacBook resolution. I.e. yeah, it's really high res vs others but it's actually intended to draw the same thing with more pixels not to fit more in.
+ abdullah abdulaziz the short / technical answer, is mathematics. The legible answer is, so it takes good pictures. To my knowledge, multiple lenses are normally used to optimize and correct for various issues. These pages have some nice reading: and The Z1 I assume has a Back Side Illuminated (BSI) sensor like most phones today. It's a technique for increasing the amount of light that gets into the aperture, so to speak.

Gloves because you never know when you'll need to cap someone and plenty the evidence?
This why I will likely be re ripping my DVD collection when the next gen codecs become more widly supported. I'm using H.264 with either AAC or AAC+AC3 pass-thru. Not all of my hardware reacted well to H.262/AC-3 decode, and I can usually transcode without losing too much quality vs the MakeMKV output from my DVDs.
