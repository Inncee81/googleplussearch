Gladwell's books and logic have never really been rigorous enough for more than coffee-table conversation. They're interesting and thought-provoking, but no pop-sci book should stand as a replacement for reading primary sources. I'd question the integrity of any author who said otherwise. It bothers me that some people ascribe such authority to what is essentially scifi.
