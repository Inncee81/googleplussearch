OUYA just doesn't have the value proposition. Yeah, it runs Android. Does it run the Android games I already invested in? No? Not interested. Plus the build quality on this thing is a let down, and the controllers are horridly expensive for what they are. Right now, I am a bit more interested in the MadCatz MOJO. It has Play Store access, which adds a value proposition. You mean I can take advantage of the games I have already bought on Android? Now you have my full attention!
