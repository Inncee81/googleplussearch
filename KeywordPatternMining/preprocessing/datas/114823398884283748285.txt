And that is why I have two phone bills in collections. After getting treated like crap do you think I'm going to pay you extra to leave phone companies can f#@& off if they think a contract can keep me paying a disrespectful company. They should be reqired to have a clause in the contract that voids it if a customer gets disrespcted.
