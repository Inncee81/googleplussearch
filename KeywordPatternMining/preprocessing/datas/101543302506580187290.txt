I love + Ronnisha Cotton because she cuts it with no care.
+ Moilim Yacoub stfu about sd cards. No the fuck it will not. Why is it you over seas guys troll every nexus post or any new phone release post with this bullshit? You expect us to go backwards w/o progressive technology advancements? You guys all post under every fucking article about a got damned SD CARD or REMOVABLE BATTERY. Use Google Music or go get you a Samsung and be happy. That shit is old news. Nobody but a few douches gives a fuck about an SD or removable battery anymore. God fucking Lee. There will never be an SD card or removable batteries on any Nexus. You know this. Stop trolling.
+ Jayfo Nitrof no it's a desire. A want. Not a necessity like you guys are making it. Never going to happen. Get over it and move on. Google had said they're moving away from removable storage and batteries. What part is confusing to you all? LG G2 had neither and guess what? I can breath, eat, shit, browser, download, masturbate and fall asleep and go to work as normal. You'll be okay. Don't like it? Then there's plenty of other shit producing manufacturers who make good sub 2009-era phone you know and love. Get a goo-phone.
+ Matias Duarte interview last year. He explained why. Google it. Not hard to find. It's not Apple like at all. If you have to switch batteries that often then you need a new phone bro. + Jayfo Nitrof Muting the thread. Losing brain cells by the moment.
