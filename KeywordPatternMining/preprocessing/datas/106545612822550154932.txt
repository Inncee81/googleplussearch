I call that thing 'the nausea bringer'.
No, I can play Mirrors Edge, something is always in focus. With that evil contraption I feel like I've been hit in the head. Having 20/20 all my life I'm really sensitive to focus issues.
The 'ghetto audio silencer ' is awesome.
thats interesting stuff - I need a 1:1 macro for my 5N. I'd like to do this sort of thing.
How is the manual focus on it? I assume good , the quality of your macro stuff is really good. I might pick up a manual macro if I can find a good deal <whynotboth.jpg>.
why is it that people want to shit on Ken Rockwell? Everything I've read seems well informed and he presents well reasoned opinions. Well, I just answered my own question, didn't I?
I don't understand Hasselbald - do people really pay more for cosmetically tarted up electronics like this?
If I can resist other gadget lust purchases, I might be able to get one next year. I am really missing a viewfinder on my 5n , especially outdoors in the bright colorado sun. Landscapes are damn near impossible.
Good point. A 7 would do just fine as I wait for prices to fall or a new model of the full frame emount.
One of my co-workers has one , it truly is a nice camera. He wouldn't sell it even if he buys a A7. I'll have to setup some ebay alerts for the NEX-7.
That about sums it up. as someone that has been in all those roles, I endorse this totally.
Damn - that may take a chunk out of next year's toy budget.
