The yellow one was identified, same family of spiders as the garden spider, just a slightly different type.
Wash your mouth out! Spiders are great. Fascinating creatures and without them we'd be overrun with lots of flying insects that are a genuine pain, like mosquitoes etc.
Erm? Top fast on the Wessex way?I wish! Especially where the two accidents were today. Fuckwit drivers is the reason for crashing, but there has to be a reason for crashes to justify camera, lower speed limits and other bullshit. Simple fact is plenty of people just shouldn't be driving.
I mean, how the fuck do you hit a tree on the Wessex way? FFS!
