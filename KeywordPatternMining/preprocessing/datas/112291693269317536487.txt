I've done that trick a few times on my nexus 7 and my nexus s 4g and have had no problems since. So it's fine, it's not a bug or anything critical.
None of the stores here are selling the new Kit Kats, I've seen some stores with freshly stocked Kit Kats but nothing with the Google promotion so I guess I'm SOL as I probably live in BFE right now lol
