More like an average middle class essential. Lots of houses had encycopedias, if not Britannicas, then World Books or some other variety.
Along with a high pressure door-to-door sales process that guilted a lot of parents into buying them for their children's education. My point is that they were pretty common features of ordinary houses where I grew up. They weren't only a thing for the wealthy.
An seen as a good investment at the time. At least before Wikipedia came along. My kids have rarely resorted to using our set of World Books (that I picked up from a junk shop for $50) but I have to say that we have used them, their entries turn out to be much better written and useful than the equivalent Wikipedia entry.
