The + Sony Xperia Z1, The QX100 and the headphones are my top three! I look forward to putting all three in my bag as soon as we get a launch date on the Z1 from + T-Mobile !
+ Henry Pham -- the + Sony Xperia Z1 is available in the US as of this week. You can order it via the Sony online store. Alas, it's only HSPA+ and not LTE. I really hope to see the LTE version come from + T-Mobile , otherwise it's a non-starter for me.
It was great to hear that the + Sony Xperia Z1 is finally available in the US, along with the Z Ultra. Now I hope to see it in + T-Mobile stores soon!
Agreed, + Andrew Renkert . It is taking way too long for + Sony Xperia to get the Z1 stateside. + T-Mobile already carries the Z! I don't see reason we should have to wait so long... Nexus 5 may launch next week and I'm also considering a Moto X.
Wow, + Bill Hubbell ! I think that's the longest comment I've ever read! Good comments, and I agree that functionality is what matters. I'm on a Galaxy Note II on + T-Mobile and I'm looking at either the Moto X (awesome functionality) or the Z1 (slightly less functional, but top-notch camera and more rugged -- if it EVER COMES TO T-MOBILE. Verizon certainly has better coverage, especially in rural areas, but I can't justify paying nearly double for my service, not to mention the data caps. I do have a Verizon mobile hotspot to use at work, so I'm happy with that to provide me with data and VOIP service if I'm somewhere where I don't have T-Mobile coverage.
Agreed, + Keith Heard . It's unfortunate that we have heard nothing about this phone coming to the US... + T-Mobile carries the Z and I was tempted to pick one up a while ago to replace my Galaxy Note II but I'm trying to be patient. I am hoping the + Sony Xperia Z1 replaces it soon.
