Tell me, what are your calling a "serious" gamer?
What won't? Lots of pixles? I think it's going to be flexible screens or at least curved phones
The logo is always at the bottom when on the front. It works be right below the on screen buttons. There also wouldn't be anything on the side. The back works be a little higher. Still really funny though! what is with verizon and putting their logo everywhere?!
