So + Richard Yarrell do you have an axe to grind with verizon? cause every single post that has to do with them has you hating on them big time. I have been a customer for 12 years and have had absolutely no problem with them at all. Ive had other carriers and none were anywhere close to being as reliable as verizon is. So whats the deal man?
