+ Jennifer Denevan This photo was taken at the back of a school where only these trees were the only maple. Everything else are pine green. Taken yesterday. There was another lady taking photo. Yes, autumn colors are so dramatic. If not taken in the right timing, it is hard to produce a good result.
The sun is 45 degrees to my right and just giving a bit light to the leaves. The leaves are extending outward covering the trunks and not that many. I think I caught just the right timing.. Felt like it was going to rain. Behind me was taller pine trees. These are the only maple trees and everything else are green.
The camera kit I used is not even an entry level but works perfectly in low light situations.
+ Georg Mahal Thank you. All the while I was setting up the Camera, their eyes did not move a bit watching me.
+ Ivan bofill arasa I was in a hurry to get back home for an appointment when I took this still. When I go back to this place, I will snap a shot. This house have been in this place in downtown Toronto for over 50 years. All the surrounding structures have been modernized. There are still old Colonial and Victorian homes in different parts of the city .
I am very sorry, about posting so much. It will never happen again. I did include the settings I use for the camera.
I was walking when I took this still.
+ Carleen Amadio Thank you very much......ï»¿I had difficulty taking this still. I had several takes and this one is I think the best with an almost BW 3D feel to it. No tripod and the Sony cam I used I believe is not even an entry level but takes good stills. I took all the stills I posted just in a day walking downtown Toronto.

Trio with F3.... I was about 7 to 9m away when I took this still inside a big mall in the eastern side of the City. SONYF3KSEL1855-1/80 f5.0 iso2000
It was difficult to capture because the subject is always moving unpredictably plus the lighting is not that much. Thank you.
Attempted to capture "Flight of the Seagull". I don't even think that I would capture it this way. I am not even sure if my F3 will automatically adjust itself to the fast moving object. But it did. Sony F3KSEL1855
That is the future we are facing but what is more important is the name has a very distinct ring to it.
