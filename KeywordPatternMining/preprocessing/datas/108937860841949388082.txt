Sorry - as said above, not keen on the tilt. Even if you miss this in camera, it can easily be corrected in post. Also confused as to why there's noise / grain in the sky areas.
+ Max Kotchouro I'm glad you stand by your choices on this photo. After all it's your art and your vision. I see what you mean by the lines and angles but still perceive a tilt - if you rotate the image a few degrees clockwise the perceived tilt should be balanced out. Unfortunately the telegraph pole, and majority of the verticals on the house have a slight left angle on them - very slight, but combines to give the impression of leaning.
#delete2 Sorry but I really am not a fan of the processing here. To get that dynamic range you've all but flattened the tones and while theres a surreal amount of detail, I'm disturbed by the lack of deep shadow and contrast. This may work for some people and I get that - even respect it, but it's not for me.
