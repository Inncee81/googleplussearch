Not sure if I agree that google+ is leading the way. Adobe does it as well, and its tools are way more robust.
Actually Adobe allows groups of people to all work on same image that's stored on the cloud. The actual tools are on your comp which I prefer since I don't want to be required to be online to work on my photos. Not to mention much better tools that work with RAW images. G+ is good for casual photographer but not nearly good enough for serious photographers.
