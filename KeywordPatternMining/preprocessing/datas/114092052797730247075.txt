Holy huge review! Great write-up Gordon Loving my GX7 as well! Only feature I wish would be changed is the auto exposure bracketing. I hate that you have to hold down the shutter button to take the brackets instead of having a two second delay then kicking off the brackets. Also wish it could do more brackets than 7 and more than +-3 EV. Same goes for the GH3.
