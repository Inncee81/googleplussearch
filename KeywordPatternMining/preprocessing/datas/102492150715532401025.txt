Why you should question just everything you ever heard about social media. This is my keynote speech at Social Data Week. Let's just say that it wasn't "expert" and "agency" friendly.

Trey Ratcliff saved my life Let’s start at the beginning shall we This photo means so much more than just pixels on the screen to me, I have been dealing with depression most of my life and as I am getting older it seems that I have less and less to offer and life has little meaning other than going to work and trying to be a good father in-between. Sometime in October I stumbled into the stuck in customs website and my first introduction into HDR photography, I was captivated by what could be achieved. This gave me a new purpose in life my children mean everything to me but I needed something that I can call my own, something that I could create, something that gave me purpose as I felt lost and life had little meaning. I have been using G+ for some time as well and through photography I was making new connections as I started to be a part of a group, I have met so many people in G+ and on photo walks as I am incredibly/ painfully shy – meeting people was way outside of my comfort zone, now most of these people I can call friends and this was a huge leap – finally I had a purpose and felt like I belonged. This photo represents a merging of all those things, it was taken on my second day in New Zealand late November last year where my wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and everything just came together at that point and that is why Trey Ratcliff saved my life and he did not even know it

I feel very fortunate to have stumbled upon this man and his dogs in Paris several years ago. He reminds me of the struggles of life, the hardships we all endure. He also reminds me how very blessed we are with such wonderful family and friends. I hope that he too, someday, will know the same. Until then, he relies on the compassion of others and the love of his dogs to get by. Tout le meilleur mon ami.
