Take a look at this Novo Cam, GH3 with manual aperture and else:
Hi, + Davide DiBi ! Nice to know you. Usually I design my story before I go to the site where I want to shoot. I kinda imagine what to shoot from what I've read on my simple research. I list all the shots that I'm going to shoot. The problem is, sometimes I only put all the storyboard inside my head, then the whole team will be asking me back and forth what to do next, what to shoot next, etc. But my point being is, if you have your designed story at least in your head, thats a start!
