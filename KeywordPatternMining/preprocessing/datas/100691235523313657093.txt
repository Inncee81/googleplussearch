The key questions are: 1) which half of the world, 2) what's the standard deviation of the average speed reported above. 3) If the countries in the set that contribute to the above average belong to certain geographical locations, wouldnt it also tell more about the locations itself and not just their internet speeds (i.e., the same countries would have positive indicators in other aspects as well such as economy, etc.), 4) What's the underlying distribution of their data-set (e.g., a gaussian, a uniform, etc. distribution)
