That's sound really great. But what I'd like to know is.... Who has any invites?
+ Stefan Svartling it's ok. I'm just really curious that's all. Happy with Nova atm
Hmmmm my last experience with Sony was the original xperia mini. Atrocious is one of the best to describe it. I hope it's unopened. But 10 ft poles will be dragged out when it comes to Sony phones.
10ft poles my friend. I even did a ritual and swore by it. "by all that is Android I will never try Sony again" at this point flashing lightening sort of seals the deal. LG and Google might get the same treatment soon. Had to order replacement for defective Nexus 4 today. They're on thin ice.
Indeed. I acknowledge the Z1 it's awesome. In fact I'd recommend it as the only alternative to S4 or HTC One. It has the best of both devices in one. I'm already decided that next year will be a high end flagship.
