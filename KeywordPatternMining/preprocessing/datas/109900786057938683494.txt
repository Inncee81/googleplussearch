Nice. My bag contains a + Sony a65 with kit lens, Tamron 70-300 and a Jessops flash gun. If + Sony would like to donate something, I'm happy to accept.
Not sure why + Sony have called this the a3000 when it uses e mount lenses. That may confuse some people.
P.s looking forward to getting my + Sony a65 next weeekend.
+ Sony Xperia are you going to do something about the awful battery life on the Xperia Z? It is shockingly bad, with the disgraceful stamina mode I am able to get just over a days use. By a day I mean a normal waking day. The camera is average at best and if you use it for more than 10 ,mins it gets extremely hot.
+ Vera Platt I see where you are coming from. But if you compare it to a Samsung Note 2, that phone can last 2-3 days with average and it doesn't have a stamina mode. With the Z, you need.the stamina mode to it last a day. The note 2 also has a far bigger screen, and the 8meg camera is better. Lesson learnt: buy a Samsung phone in future.
+ Migz Calderon I bought my Z 5 months ago, not long after itnhad been released. + Sony Xperia knew there were so many issues with it, which is why they bought out the Z1. From now on I will not buy anything from Sony again. I was going to upgrade my camera from the a37 to the a77, but now I'm switching to + Canon SLR instead.
After using the awful Xperia Z, I won't be buying another sony mobile.
+ Qasim Hussain yes there is. + Samsung Mobile phones are better than + Sony Xperia phones. Can't wait to get rid of my Z for a Samsung Note 2. Camera on Z is average at best and battery life is a complete joke.
And it awful on the Z.
+ Anders Holck as another user like you who has experience with DSLR I have to.agree with + Lee Casey the camera on the Z is a joke and I've seen results that show the Z1 isn't much better. My advice, by a Samsung. Better phone, better battery, better camera.
+ Walter van Lille a lot of it depends on the software the phone uses for the camera. + Samsung Mobile kicks + Sony Xperia ass in this department amd many others.
They said the same thing about the Z. Camera on that is average at best. An 8 meg on the Galaxy note is better.
+ Lee Casey I have the same issue. Camera on the Z is a joke. My wife's Samsung Note 2 is far better and it's only an 8 meg camera.
Everything the Xperia Z was meant to be but failed.
