#delete6 I agree on the focus 'issue'. Which I hate because I really enjoyed the image overall.
#delete7 Both colors and comp do not quite make it for me.
#delete6 I just cropped this in my head, with just a bit of the silhouetted trees, the birds in the sky, and the sunrise. It worked quite nicely I think.
#delete7 I like most of it. But this composition does not portray it enough as the star of the moment for me. Kind of pushing it out of frame.
Crêpes are great. Even though I seem to have missed the link between what you said, the image, and myself. But we should definitely have a crêpe-party some day.
#delete8 I too hate those places I love to see, then try to capture them, and find no global composition that seems to click. That and the tilt is a bit annoying. Nice/fun thing about it is the balance with the pole in the bottom right corner though.
#save2 At first sight I was about to delete, then I enjoyed the mood in those unreal colors.
#delete3 Processing is fine by me, except for the left and right buildings which seem to suffer from halos (but as always... I could be wrong). I think both the door (and its lamp) on the right and the lamp-post in the middle are interesting, but they end up being a bit forgotten in the whole scene. For example, the building on the far left, which is 'nice but not so nice' drives my attention when really it is not the most interesting thing in the image. I liked how it drove the viewer to this sunset in the middle though... Hence, I think getting closer might have enabled getting a nice sunset shot with lamp-post in the foreground and these buildings on the left (and their street) as leading lines.
