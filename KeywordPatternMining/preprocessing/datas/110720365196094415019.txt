He can't + Elizabeth Lund he sold it....but not to me
Whew - I"m off the hook!! ;)
Damnit....I just was looking at the 6D - found a really great deal with 2 lenses at Costco....I really want a full frame and at least the 6D is less than the 5D Mark III! (I will however go look). You're mean!!! HAHAHAHAHA
ARGH!!!! I actually am going to have to pass....going to be responsible for once - the money I have in my savings account is earmarked for a photography workshop in Brussels and a trip to Portugal next June...... Good luck with selling it all!!!
Holy crap.....scared to go look...especially since I've been wanting to upgrade my camera!!!
I love this!!
