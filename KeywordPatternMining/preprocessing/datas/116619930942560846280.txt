to get or not to get this is my huge dilemma
i like the simplicity of the nexus yet the complexity of the samsung
glad to see weird sony at it again
i feel for the people who text and drive and talk and drive. hands free is the way to go but just teaching them the basics of handling a mobile phone while driving is all it should take. i think they need to implement it in the testing of new drivers to see how they can cope by answering a mobile phone while taking a driving lesson on a track or advanced driver training.
