My son at 4 has independant use of the internet and gadgets. However every device and computer he has access to has strict security controls in place so he can only see content I want him to see. Search engines are even removed or restricted from use as an added security measure from him seeing any non age appropriate material.
+ Bill Layman If parents are giving thier children unfettered access without supervision ... ill leave my thought there.
Net Nanny is highly regarded amoung parents in my office for android. I use kids place but its more for young children than teens, you could use it for teens but that could get interesting.
