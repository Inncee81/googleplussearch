+ Daniel Roca I personally agree that this is in the wrong community, just because it's negative to ps4 doesn't mean it's positive to #xboxone and if I want PS news I'll go to the PS community. That being said, you are also in the wrong community and have done this exact same thing repeatedly. You need to piss off back to your own community and stfu. Its the biggest case of pot calling the kettle black I've seen in months. #hypocrite
