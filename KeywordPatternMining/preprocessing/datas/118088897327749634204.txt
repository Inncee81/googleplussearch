It's getting better! This might be a good choice for my daughter, if it can do any sort of macro-ish in addition to the zoom.
I'd go for the lower resolution model unless the higher one is noticeably better in low light. From the specs it's hard to tell. Also depends on how fast and effective each of the AF's are, especially in low light.
I'll be arriving Friday as well, staying at St Patrick's. Looking forward to seeing you!
