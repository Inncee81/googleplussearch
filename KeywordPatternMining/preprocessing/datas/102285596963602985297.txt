Looks pretty nice, I like its design, plus the fact that it's a Nexus, oh yes
It even looks better than HTC One which is a beautiful phone, indeed so.
I am rocking the Z1 right now, in love with this phone, absolutely fastest for me right now, impressive battery life and build quality, but I can also totally dig that Nexus 5 as well
Definitely not, not now after getting the Z1, there's no need for it anymore.
