You do get what you pay for, "upgraded" to a pair of Sony NC8 headphones that had a nice price, but the noise cancelling doesn't seem to do much and there is now exposed wiring at the Y where the sheathing came loose.
I just hope it's coming to the US before the Nexus 5 blows it out of the water.
+ Darnell Thompson there is a lot more to a phone than just the camera, though. If the Nexus 5 is really going to be $299 off contract, it would be really hard to justify paying $700 including subsidies.
Since it's resampling a 20.7 MP input down to 8 MP, it has a little bit of basically lossless zoom. It would be interesting if Sony took the slim optical zoom setup from their Cybershot T-line and put it in a phone.
+ Devesh Parboteeah unfortunately it's a complex question. You can read reviews with example photos and videos, but this is the basic idea: - The Z1's sensor is physically larger than the sensor in most smartphones, which allows it to potentially capture more light/detail. The sensor size matches many of Sony's point & shoot cameras. - It also has a very large pixel count, 20.7 MP. Most of the time, though, the extra resolution is used for what is called pixel binning. Basically that means it uses the light information captured from (for example) 4 pixels on the sensor to create 1 pixel in the image. Theoretically this can lead to pictures with less noise and therefore better low light performance - The reality is that all this information still needs to be processed, and despite the claims of using the BIONZ image chip from their point & shoot cameras, many reviews say the pictures are good, but not consistent, even in Superior Auto mode which is supposed to figure out all the proper settings automatically, and not better than the results you can get from an iPhone 5.
+ Sony Xperia hopefully in the future you will be able to take a page from your top competitors and get a nearly simultaneous international release (without delaying the European and Asian release for months while our dinosaur-like carriers drag their feet).
