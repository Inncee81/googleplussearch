Well of course gamers are going to take advantage of glitches. I don't know if I'd ban them for it, I'd probably just fix the glitch.
That things look extremely dated. Plus it probably won't be a big seller except by major uber fanboys. The screen looks horrible and how much are the games going to be? $500-600 like back in the day? lol Plus you can get a lot of these games on PSN and Live arcade. Before I traded in my xbox I had samurai showdown (cool game) and a few other SNK titles. This thing is relatively dated.
But they're 300 MEG! Or something like that, whatever the reason was they gave for charging that much for cartridges. That was a bored rich man's console. Yeah it's pre-loaded with stuff but is it every game? I don't know, the article didn't say.
I think it's somewhat important to see what one console will offer over the other in the form of software. From a developer's standpoint it's just stupid. You're limiting your income by doing it, but for the consumer it gives them a little more leverage on what system they plan to buy. I know people buying the new Xbox because of one game. They are paying 500 bucks to play one game! And that game is either Killer Instinct or Halo 5. Neither of those are worth paying 500 bucks plus the game's retail or add-on prices. I'm going to need a whole lot more reasons to jump into a console than one or two games haha. But for some, that was enough.
+ Marcos Silveira LoL, maybe if the game's "dedicated" servers didn't completely suck ass and if the weapons weren't so inconsistent. After three titles Epic was never able to get that right. And I bought the "EPIC" edition of Gears 3. When it first came out it was great, I loved it. After two months all the bugs and latency showed up along with having to shoot someone 5 and 6 times at close range for gnasher kills. I won't even go into GoW Judgement because People Can Fly butchered that game to hell.
Oh! HAHAHAHA!!! That's funny because I was just playing God of War III like an hour ago. My bad bro, the last 6 or 7 years whenever I saw GoW it always meant Gears because I was on a different console. And as you can see, the Gears franchise has upset me in the past lol. I got confused because you said GoW on Xbox.
I'm glad I'm back with Sony after this current gen is wrapping up. The $600 price tag made my 360 decision easy but their poor launch with the ps3 taught Sony a lot of lessons that they learned from. This next gen launch is proof of that and I look forward to November 15.
I was never too impressed with the Vaio brand. It's interesting how the Xperia lineup of phones and tablets can be pretty great and then the Vaio lineup pretty much the opposite of great.
