+ Stefan Svartling how is the camera ? my Z1 is arriving tomorrow I have had the S4, HTC one and have iPhone 5S looking forward to seeing how it compares
+ Stefan Svartling + Robert Sørensen I have the 5S and I think the day light images are more washed out than the 5. Will see how the Z1 compares.
+ Stefan Svartling + Robert Sørensen yeh to be honest they are all pretty amazing to where they were a few years back and so far all have their plus and minus. My friend has just got the Lumia 1020 which is amazing but very slow to take a picture.
+ Stefan Svartling + Robert Sørensen all good love and be loved! It's only a phone!
