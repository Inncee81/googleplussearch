He's mis-explaining fractional reserve. It's actually much worse . Fractional reserve banking with a 10% reserve doesn't mean that if you deposit $100, the bank can loan out $90 of it. A 10% fractional reserve means that if you deposit $100, the bank can use that $100 as the reserve backing upon which they can loan out $1000. Where does the other $900 come from? Thin air, and they just hope it never all gets called in at once.
