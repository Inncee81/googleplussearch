With all these rumours about the Google Gem smartwatch... I guess it makes perfect sense if they announce it bundled along with the Nexus 5?

Take with the + Sony Xperia Z1. Quite surprised at how a drunken shot of Jagermeister came out so good! #Sony #sonyxperiaz1
From what I remember, I just put it on Manual mode and set it to the 20 megapixels. The ISO I left under auto. If you're using Superior Auto, it does tend to give you a lot of noise in the picture.
100th Episode of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, how good can a show of 4 complete degenerate assholes be this good?
Samsung is king at adding stupid gimmicks, features and stuff you'll never really be doing much with.
Seriously the Google #Chromebook has been one of the best purchases I've ever made tech wise.
Fuck man, that introduction in Disney Pixar's Up... Right in the feels every damn time.
Sony Xperia Z1 & Sony SmartWatch 2 Review Introduction On the 19th of March 2013 I posted a review of the Sony Xperia Z smartphone. The Z series are Sony's high end flagship devices. Fast forward to the present, I was very happy and satisfied with my Xperia Z but a few months down the line I notic...
All of a sudden, unknowingly, I own all things #Sony + Sony Xperia Z1 #SonySmartWatch2
+ Azry Jawi I've posted my thoughts on the watch on my blog, feel free to check it out:
+ Matthew Richardson yeah they are.
+ Marques Brownlee really raves about those headphones and his video reviews are always spot on.
+ tiger meng I have no need for that, not much of a photographer :P
+ Rahat Lateef it's the whole package and not just the camera for me ;) More so that it's waterproof. To me the awesome camera is a bonus that compliments all the other great specs.
Anyone own the SBH 52?
+ Séan Brown I have a section on my blog where I review the Z1 and the SW2. Feel free to check it out.
+ Andrew Ciubotariu They are indeed awesome! They have great reviews all round and they are very affordable with a very nice premium look. This model is called Sony MDR ZX600
I actually just sold it to make way for the funding of the Z1 ;)
Most of the content of my new blog post is ready. Need to add pictures and a few bits and bobs. #XperiaZ1 review. + Sony Xperia www.danielghio.com
There seems to be an awful lack of watch faces for the + Sony Xperia SmartWatch 2. Will more be available after software updates?
I'm not a developer myself but if that's true then Sony have definitely messed up on a simple feature that most other "SmartWatches" strive upon... such as the Pebble. I checked out some of the reviews of custom faces on the Play Store and they are indeed battery eaters... Such a shame, lets hope that with future updates things get better.
At the moment I'm on the fence, it came bundled for free with my Z1 purchase so in that respect I can't complain. Would I buy one outright if it wasn't bundled? Probably not at the moment, but it's cool to own one and you can see the potential behind it. Needs more apps, for example a twitter client would be cool, instead of just receiving notifications, would be nice to be able to read my twitter timeline on it. The next coming year the market is going to get swamped with "SmartWatches" and Sony has the opportunity to set a good standard for it... whether they will take advantage and provide decent software updates... we'll see.
Nope, on one of my other posts someone stated that the ability to add widgets such as the music player will come via a software update.
I keep seeing that music widget on all + Sony Xperia SmartWatch 2 promo shots... but I can't find it on my watch!?
I feel stupid but has anyone managed to find that music player widget that are on the Sony SmartWatch 2 promo shots?
The watch is out in Europe as far as I know... I have one myself. It came with my + Sony Xperia Z1.
No problem Yeah Sony have been giving the SmartWatch 2 away with early Z1 orders.
+ Jonathan Hjertström I already had that one installed. I assume Sony will be updating that app so we can add widgets in the near future to the watches home screen.
