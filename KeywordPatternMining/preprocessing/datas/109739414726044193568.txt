Hope so that and the last have us have set a real mature and quality benchmark I really want a sequel for both. And beyond two souls looks set to meet or raise the bar aswell
I remember having a breif go at a friends never owned it though
I just got a dreamcast might see if I can grab a soul reaver cheap see what your fascination is all about + Richard Dixon lol
I hate it I feel like if I get 1 more request am going to beat zuckerberg to death!!!!
Its not the game I dont mind its the requests to play it I get bout 4 a day minimum its making that much money because its really rammed down your throat! I love them puzzle games like tom blitz on the vita but if I got notifications all day to play it I would start loathing it just as fast!
