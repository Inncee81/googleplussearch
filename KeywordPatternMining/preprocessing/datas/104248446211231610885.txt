Beautiful place - and excellently captured. The landscape reminds me a lot of Scotland and bits of Dartmoor, except on a much larger scale. It looks just as wet, though...!
Exciting! I'm looking forward to this one, despite not intending to buy it. My Nexus 4 is still going strong and despite the odd hiccup, it does everything I want and more. It seems prudish to throw money at a new phone when the one I've got is brilliant! I'm interesting from a technological viewpoint though. + Miguel Bleau Buying an expensive phone as a backup? Fancy buying one for me too? ;-) I can't even imagine the concept of having a backup phone!
Out of curiosity, why do you need two phones? I sometimes carry two (on-call at work) but my on-call phone is a Nokia Â£10 jobby. Does the trick!
