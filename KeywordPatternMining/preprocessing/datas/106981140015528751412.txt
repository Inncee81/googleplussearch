Glad you're enjoying your second trip to Denver! Some other fun things to see / photograph if you have the time: * The murals in the foyer of the Mountain States Telephone company building (931 14th St., near Curtis) * The big blue bear (officially, "I See What You Mean") at the convention center * The Ghost Building at 18th & Stout * At night, the Denver Gas & Electric building (15th & Champa, hosts 13,000 light bulbs)
