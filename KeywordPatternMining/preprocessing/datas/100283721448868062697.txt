Same! couple of minor issues with mine to start off with but that seems to be resolved now I've got a dock on the way as recommended by + Rich Fletcher so hopefully i won't break the flap ;) I think i would quite like a Sony tablet but i dont really use my Nexus 7 (hence the reason for selling it) but a Sony Chromebook... now that would be interesting!
+ Tim Morley I had a Galaxy Nexus and went to the Z1 and it's just so much better! Really like the phone and just feels like premium hardware a bit like when i held the HTC One for the first time. I'd been so used to Samsung phones like the Galaxy Nexus and S2 and the S4 (the latter two my wife had/has).
I'm enjoying mine to even with a couple of annoyances so far...
Only problem is + Sarah Ellis is that it's not a phone ;)
are you saying you walked out with a Z1 or you nearly did?
I did read somewhere on XDA that the International one didn't come with the Sony Account Manager which either way isn't likely to be a great loss. I suppose if you go International then perhaps any updates that come out are likely to hit a bit quicker than a UK version? I did however read that Sony may be skipping 4.3 and going straight to 4.4 aiming for around mid-november but we'll have to see about that!

That's just an Amazon Seller trying to get in on the hype...
