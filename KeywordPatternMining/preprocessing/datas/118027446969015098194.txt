Hey guys Im new to google + and i didnt know how else to make my own comment but if you could PLEASE read this to see if you can help in any way! About two years ago I bought a NWZ-s540 Walkman and it was doing just great. Until, one day i reset the MP3 player and I connected it to my computer to transfer songs and it froze. I was clueless at first but then i forgot to let the MP3 player finish resetting and now it just rewinds and fast fowards by itself. and sometimes when i want to listen to music, i literally have to stomp on it and see if i hit the buttons hard enough so a song can play because the buttons dont work unless i stomp on it and i looked at a youtube video about my problem and the lady said to go to your website and enter my model number for my Walkman. So, I did and it asked me if I had an extension plan or something along those lines and i didnt know if i did so i stopped their and i decided to email you guys because I Have no clue what to do now and if you could give me some advice wether to ship it to you but the only problem is I checked on the website and it said you guys dont make anymore models of the one a currently own right now. Please Help!!
