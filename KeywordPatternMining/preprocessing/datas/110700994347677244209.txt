Love the N7, I have an iPad and the size of the N7 is perfect compared to the larger tablet!
+ Germano Lisboa The 7" is much more comfortable for gaming and reading at long lengths IMO. Especially if reading in bed.
+ Germano Lisboa I have only had mine 3 days but it has decent battery life from what I can tell so far. I'd say about 8-9 hours, it is almost on par with my iPad.
The G2 is horrible, about as bad as the Nexus 4. Give me an iPhone 3Gs over anything LG makes.
+ Sean Socoloski thanks. Verizon spokesperson speaking on social media. Gonna Tweet this screenshot now.
I was only kidding. I don't care what phone anyone likes or carries. I simply said my N4 is a piece of garbage. Every LG phone I have ever owned as been.
+ Dave Oniel i used the Nexus 4 to post this. the hardware is cheap crap.
+ Dave Oniel price does not matter, putting out a quality product with your name on it does. An iPad mini only cost $300, why is it not crap?
