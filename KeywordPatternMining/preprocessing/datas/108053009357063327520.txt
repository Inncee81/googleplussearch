I want it! The best phone with a bigger screen can't get any better.
Aha ok but the camera is not so important for me, I mostly surf and watch movies and play games on my phone.
I want to see what the price lands on first but I will most likely buy it.
If you look at the picture the date on the phone is set to 16 October, I wonder if that have anything with release to do. Maybe they use that date for all commercial pictures.
Latest nightly works ok except for a few Google app crashes. Chrome, keep, drive hangouts and some other.
Hmm that's what I did
+ Stefan Svartling I reinstalled latest nightly CyanogenMod from scratch and now it works much better, no crashes on my HTC one. Thanks for the tip!
