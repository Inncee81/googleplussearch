Great pics and wonderful time off!
how do you manage that level of focussing?…… insane considering it's not even a macro lens (right?)
Ah! So this is indeed a macro… Very nice! Even more impressive with manual focus and at only f/4… (hey and you need to do vacuum on your steps ;-p or stop using macro there
+ Martin Irwin wow.. so that was quite a set to take that pic there Be careful with doing too much vacuum - or you might loose your cute inhabitants ;)
