My first SLR was bought for me at the ripe old age of 14 !! A Pentax me super, hadn't a clue how to use it really other than the lady in the shop showing me how to load the film ! So I immersed myself into photography books and bascially self taught through trial and error. I was lucky to secure a work placement at a local high street studio when I was 16 and what I learned there has proved invaluable over the years. Once I actually left school I got a part time job at Jessops which in due course turned into a full time job that lasted over 7 years until I left in the late 90s. As you would imagine working at jessops I've probably owned just about every make and model of SLR imaginable at some point !! But my favourite were always Nikon F series especially thr FE2 coupled with an MD12 winder. Sadly these days I'm not as passionate about photography I just can't seem to get away with all this image manipulation, to me back in my day you got the shot right when you pressed the release !! The joy of seeing that result later on after development was the buzz for me Spending hours manipulating an image to look amazing just takes the enjoyment out of it were not photographers anymore were photoshopographers
