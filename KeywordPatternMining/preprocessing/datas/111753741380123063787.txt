Could it be because most of the "good stuff" in the App Store are "paid apps" while you can find equivalent or better apps in the Play Store for free?
Wasn't trying to start a "fan boy" flame war but sometimes I forget where I'm at I guess. An example of my initial comment. I have a speedometer app on my Evo from the Play Store that was free and "works great" but all the speedo apps in the App Store cost money. That's just one example...
+ Ryan Groe that's a good question but I doubt it.
