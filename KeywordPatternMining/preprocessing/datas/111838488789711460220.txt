I am looking for something that I can plug into the headphone jack on my stereo which then plays music over wireless speakers I can carry outside to the jacuzzi (preferably battery powered, but not necessarily so). This seems like such a simple, obvious thing, but I haven't been able to find anything which fits the bill (instead, all I find are weird things like this "Sonos" speaker, which I can't even figure out why anyone would ever want). Any suggestions?
RE: Sonos Play5 ... $400 for a wireless speaker?? That's demented. My wireless headphones cost $100, and in my opinion that was outrageously expensive.
People keep mentioning "support". Why on earth would that be relevant for speakers ? You buy them. You plug them in. Ten years later, maybe, you blow one, and you replace it (unless your dog chews it up sooner). It's a SPEAKER .
I grasp it fine. I just think it's absurd.
This is news? I have been using T-Mobile's free world-wide roaming for about a decade.
