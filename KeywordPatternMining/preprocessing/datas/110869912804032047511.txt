The C is not for Cheap as expected, there is minimal difference in price so there is little reason not to go for the better product. I think they learned their lesson from the ipad mini.
The colours are pretty cool, the issue as far as I can see is people have had cases on their iPhones forever and so adding colour isn't a huge selling point as your probably going to get a cover anyway. Also on the price point, the expectation was for a cheap iPhone whether Apple intended that or not. There is a segment of the market that probably aspires to have an iPhone and can't afford it, the C was expected to serve this segment but it turned out not to be the case.
+ James Devenish China, lots of customers there.
Yeah the battery life is a real concern for me, bigger screen, more powerful chip and 2300Mah battery. If its worse battery life than my Nexus 4 (which is OK but I definitely want better) I'll skip it.
+ Chris Corless I switched from the Galaxy Nexus to the Nexus 4 and never looked back. This time around I'm not so sure, then again I like buying new tech so I'm probably only kidding myself when I say I may not buy it...
+ Andrew Melder I haven't got into the habit of using a charger at work and I get through most days without bottoming out the battery. It does get sketchy on some days when I've been streaming music though and if I have something on at night I really have to be conservative. I was really hoping for a 3000mah battery so that getting through a day is something I don't even have to think about. I'd really prefer a thicker phone (with a Moto X rounded back) than a thin one that might pass out after a heavy work day.
