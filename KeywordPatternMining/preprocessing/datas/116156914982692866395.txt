AT&T shared plan was a rip-off. In fact most of what AT&T offers is a rip off. Problem is that in michigan they are the best choice for data coverage. I carry AT&T and Verizon phones daily and Verizon at most times is 56K speeds on their 3G or LTE because the towers are over packed. I wish there was a real affordable provider out there that had decent coverage as T-mobile has next to nothing here.
Gleefully waiting for mine to show up. I currently have 4 Play:3's and a Play:connect to a whole house amp for the rooms that have traditional ceiling speakers from my old Crestron audio system. I really like the capabilities of Sonos, I dont like how sensitive they are to Wifi Interference. Note the Play:3 is highly portable, we take the bathroom player out to the patio on a regular basis.
+ Brandon Blackmoor Then you will completely wig out over my $3500 pair of speakers for the living room, and those are considered not anywhere near high end.
Bose does not have a good track record of constantly supporting older product. Sonos still supports even their discontinued devices with the newer firmware. and right now Sonos beats the snot out of Bose in audio sources and streaming options. I give Sonos my money because they dont abandon their users every 12 months by discontinuing older products and then never releasing updates.
It seems that Brandon has no idea what Sonos is, nor bothers to even look it up.
No it seems you dont Brandon. Because you also must think that cars are absurd, they are just bicycles that cost way too much.
I've been running around the office putting up "Caution Dry paint" signs.
Here is hoping the next gen of ipad has the killer camera in the 5s.
iphone/ipad have AGC for the microphone, so you will never adjust it. you just need to make sure you are not overdriving if you use an external mic with that capability. For those that dont want to drop $150 large on a rode. the Audio Technica ATR55 sounds as good as the Rode for a lot less money.
