Suggestion: Pair the A7 and it's focus peaking with classic manual lenses without moto AF or zoom. Killer glass with modern focus precision at 1/20th the cost of the FF lenses that Sony will initially ship.
Right. 2x dimensions yield ~4x the area. Ah math.
+ Erkki Juurus to address your concerns, wouldn't that have just meant making it A-mount instead?
+ Erkki Juurus I see what you're saying. With their chosen strategy, they get semi-compatibility (cropped) with existing e-mount but may have sacrificed something else. Maybe they felt there would be too much outcry if e-mount was so short lived.
+ Gordon Laing I too have been wondering just how important it is anymore to have high IQ (low distortion, aberration, etc) pre-processed. Or whether it should all be judged by the end product, even if by significant corrections. What I do know is that I don't even want 36MP. Doubtful they'd have an option to turn down the RAW file sizes to 24 o 16MP. A pixel-count that high would significantly age all the gear in my workflow, which otherwise handles lower pixel-counts handily.
