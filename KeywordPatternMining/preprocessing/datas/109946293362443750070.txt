Hey + Sony , when can we get the Flip 15a here in Australia?
I originally thought the new VAIO Fit Multi-Touch, but now I'm having second thoughts. I want the 15a, but I don't think it has a HDMI, and only one USB port which fits what? Your mouse? On other thoughts, I can't see how any new cameras can trump the mighty RX100, and the new headhones really display nothing new. The awsome camera on their new Xperia is alright, but how many people really need a waterproof phone? I was planning to buy their new laptop when it was released, but I don't think I can do without a HDMI port or only one USB, and as an Architecture student, I need a decent graphics card. Why + Sony WHY?
Wow, I guess that's all true! Thanks + David Hill and + Marcus Randolph !
+ Sony , when is the Vaio Flip series being released in Australia? How much will it cost? I can't wait! Also, will the Sony Store be able to apply upgrades straight to the computer, or will it have to be specially ordered??
Why is that a shame? I love + Sony
Wait. Is it part of the fit lineup? I thought it was an Ultrabook. I keep reading + Sony Vaio Fit Multi-touch, and then sometimes Flip? Can anyone help?
Does the + Sony Vaio Fit Multi-touch Flip 15a only have 1 USB 3 port? And does it even have HDMI?
+ Dominic Lacerenza Are you sure? I think the Old Vaios, such as the E series were quite average, but the T series is pretty good, the Pro is awesome, the Vaio Fit is alright, and the new Vaio Flip, I think, is one of the best designed laptops ever! How can you compete with this new range?
what about something like the Pro 13, but with the power and Graphics of the Fit 15? That would rock.
Fine. Maybe something like Toshiba Kira, only with an awesome graphics card. Why can't + Sony do that?
