Big city dwellers don't understand that the cloud is still not ready for prime time. It's not just lack of coverage either. The data caps and extra power required to stream everything also plays a role. The biggest problem I have with no expandable storage and no removable battery is it takes choice away from me. I can understand these things if they are cost cutting measures though. They just mean that I will never be a Nexus user, at least not as my everyday phone.
+ Andrew Moore I'm glad to hear battery life is improving as the platform matures. I know with what I've been learning about how to manage the data radio I don't have to change my battery in the Note 2 as often. I would find myself running short once every couple of weeks after a 13 hour work day. I started using a battery saver app that has added close to 4 hours which gets me to bed time every night.
