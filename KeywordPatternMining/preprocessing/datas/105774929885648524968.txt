I would prefer a bigger body with that technology. I own a SLT A77 and I love this body. And today, they announced a new alpha mount camera with SLT technology for 2014, this, I don't understand.
+ Tommy Clark I totally agree. For travel photography is really nice, but for me, when I hardly take off my 70-200 f2.8 of the camera... Haha. Very little stability to take freehand pictures.
