+ Ron Amadeo Just ping someone of Google's PR people about this, after all you are now working for Arstechnica ;) I got my verification one year ago that way.
+ Ron Amadeo Nah, unfortunately I'm based in Austria so I bugged the local Google PR people (via old-school mail ;) ), those won't be much help for you, I fear.
haha, that's a pretty weird site. never heard of it before, so I guess you shouldn't take it all to seriously...
