Disappointing that its not more stable. Not so much due to mirror slap (you can always mirror lock-up or shoot live mode), but wind seems like a real problem that, short of constructing a shelter, is a bit harder to work-around.
Not to take away from the sentiment, but the exif says 9/2/01 - so I think 9 days before rather than 3 unless your camera was set wrong?
The Mandarin Oriental was a pretty amazing hotel room - probably the coolest place I've ever stayed. I do have to admit its an expensive option though. You might find a deal as its rarely full, but if you're on a budget probably need to look elsewhere.
