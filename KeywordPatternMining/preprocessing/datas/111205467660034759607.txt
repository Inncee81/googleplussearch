I know + Stefan Svartling , I really need to get out and start snapping some pictures but the weather here in the UK is miserable!
I'm not a professional photographer. However, having used a friend's 5S and my Z1 for photographing the same objects using the default camera settings, the Z1, to my untrained eye is superior. Brighter colours and sharper images. The bigger point here is that the difference between these camera is actually not very big, and overall we are leaps ahead of camera technology from even 12 months ago. So whether you've got a Z1 or a 5S, just enjoy!

Seeing as it's waterproof you can take some of the rainstorm later!
