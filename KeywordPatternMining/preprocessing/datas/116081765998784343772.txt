If Obama could make decisions on his own without fighting against his cabinet we would be in a much better economic situation. This is not a Black or White issue. This is the mess that was already there when he took office. If you want to get technical he walked into $4.93 Trillion worth of already established debt in the Bush error. It could not have gotten any better at that point. If we finger point...point at the one who created this enormous mess than sympathize with the one who catching hell trying to put us back on our feet. No matter who took office this problem was already there facing the next victim in office. Call it what you want to but in the end call it what it really is...REAL TALK
