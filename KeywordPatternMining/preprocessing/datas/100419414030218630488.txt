I almost want to agree but then you are merely stressing a point brought up by someone else which obviously the point thwn would lose its point so then guess I wont say "RIGHT ON TIM!!"and I guess I wont ask "WTF PEOPLE HAVE TO SEARCH GOOGLE TO POST SOMETHING PROFOUND..BUNCH OF DEADHEADS, RIGHT TIM?" No I wont ask that..AND I guess I won't say "GODDAMMIT! You're not intelligent if you think originality means reposting a post from a post shared with you within a circle by some other moron you then add and reshare that morons original post of a picture of Goddamn Albert Einstein or Buddah or Jesus or any president or left or right wing or a mountain sun grass water night sky or flag or a picture of THE MIND in brilliant color..with words in quotation..no, no need for that, I THINK THEY will get the picture..thats reposted with a quote by a genius that no one knows.. maybe I should just share the post....its the only thought I have....haha
