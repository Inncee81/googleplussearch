I like the high-speed shutter—no problems shooting fast lenses wide open in full sun!
Interesting that the CZ 35 f/2.8 lens isn't much bigger than the same-FOV Zuiko 17 f/1.8. I wonder at what point the smaller image circle of m43 lenses starts paying off. Certainly the full-frame equivalent of the Panasonic 45–175X would be much larger.
+ Gordon Laing The lens mount proportions on m43 mean that the rear element can be the same size as the sensor. You'd think that would help with corner sharpness and vignetting!
Looks delicious! Are those pomegranate seeds on top?

I don't think there's a wrong answer here.
Interesting how former titans Canon & NIkon are becoming increasing more irrelevant for the vast majority of photographic tasks.
Seems like the full-frame aspect would negate much of the size advantage because of the image circle and focal length needed for any kind of telephoto.
