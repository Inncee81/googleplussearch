Im just in process of moving to 3 with my 4 contracts i have with T-Mobile. Ive had the LG G2 now for 2wks and drive cross country every wk and have had no problems with signal. Better than T-Mobile i have to say. So now im going to be all 3 fo me and family i just have good things to look forward too like super fast internet until u try u dont realise how fast 3 is. Thats all i have to say on this matter at the mo.
