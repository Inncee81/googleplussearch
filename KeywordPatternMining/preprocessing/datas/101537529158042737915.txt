With Verizon you pay for what you get, is it expensive? Yes but the quality of service cant be matched. Will always have verizon.
Best buy to my knowledge does trade in devices, but will screw you left and right in price. Best bet is to sell in local online ads, like craiglist, or ebay. You will easily get 2-3 times more that way than best buy would offer.
