Fitbit's cross platform support is a big reason why i'm on that network. i guess Nike only wants users who are hip and posh enough for the iPhone. they don't want to sully their name with android support.
I hope so! I guess I'll wait on the Gear. ;)
i think for the first time ever, i had my fill of Nexus leaks. maybe cause i got that new device itch scratched with the Note 3. hehe still looking forward to the next nexus and kitkat but no longer clicking EVERY link.
