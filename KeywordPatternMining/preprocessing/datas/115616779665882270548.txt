Cool feature. I have the fz100 bridge superzoom, and the limited self timer options 2 or 10 w. 3 shots is about my only pet peeve, well that and I'd like a larger sensor. My old Canon P&S let you set the timer however you wanted it. example, wait 30 sec fire 5x. I ended up buying a wireless remote trigger but last time I tried it the batteries went dead, a phone app would've been a nice touch, since it seems Pany is against giving us more options on the timer choices.
