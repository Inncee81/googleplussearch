Congrats to the winner!
+ Justin Veldhuizen I think you might be right. His cheese cake stuff is amazing. Always makes me hungry when I see his stuff haha.
This weeks outtakes were the best yet! Congrats to the winner!
Well deserved winner. I kinda had a feeling your shot would win as soon as you posted .
They were both very good granted but I thought the colours in yours made it stand out so much more. The contrast between the cone and the sky was a really nice touch too. Beautiful shot.
