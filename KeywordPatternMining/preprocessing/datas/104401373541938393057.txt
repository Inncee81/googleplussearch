Unfortunately children being left alone is a lot more common than we would hope. Not saying its OK or understandable, but I was shocked when looking in to this a few years ago. What even more disturbing its not illegal in WA to leave children unattended as long as they are not showing signs of neglect, nothing will be done about it.
