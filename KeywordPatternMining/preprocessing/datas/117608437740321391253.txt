Very thorough review; great stuff. + Doug Kaye , I wonder if you got the X100S that I had when I rented from Borrow Lenses. It broke while I had it, but BL deemed it to not be my fault, and repaired it at no cost.to me (I of course had insurance, but there's still a deductible). I did a comparo between the X100S v. the Olympus EM-5 + 17mm v. Leica X2 when I had it. If you already have an OM-D and just want something to cover that focal length, the 17mm is a great option.
