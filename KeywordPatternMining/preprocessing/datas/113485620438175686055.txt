Its not a bad batch, u just scratched it unknowingly and its happened to me too before I got my n4. I take extremely good care of my phones and hate screen protectors. I have a tiny hairline scratch that you cannot notice at all right on the bottom of my phone under the navigation buttons but I know it was my fault for putting it in my pocket which had a zipper. No matter how much u look after a phone you will get a scratches eventually, Gorilla Glass is just a marketing term and doesn't make phones harder to scratch. I wouldn't worry about it and just enjoy your phone till the nexus 5.
