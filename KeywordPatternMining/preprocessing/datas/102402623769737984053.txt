Ordered it as soon as it popped up. ...sadly today I received an e-mail saying "sorry, we will not be shipping your order". etc etc. "if you want to cancel, click here etc." "if you want to keep your order active, don't do anything". I guess they will ship whenever they are made available to canada. In the e-mail they specified that the Chromecast has not been made available in Canada yet and much of the apps wont work. Or some bs like that ...
Yeah that's what I got
+ Kirby Gauthier I had gotten the "item has shipped" e-mail as well. Today I still received the "canceled" e-mail that + Brian Evans pasted above
