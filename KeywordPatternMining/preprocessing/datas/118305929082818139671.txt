I'm not a fanboy one way or another, but I do use an iPhone... and this is a MAJOR feature I do miss from having an Android phone.
I was really happy when there were rumors about bringing these keyboards to iPhone - but it never happened. I don't know why they don't give 3rd party access to the keyboard. Well, unless knowing Apple, they have their own version in mind.
I think this is especially true with Steve gone. He was someone we all trusted - that it may not be our favorite decision, but we trust you Mr. Jobs. Tim doesn't have that luxury. They can still keep the Apple "idea," and open things up some. Their hardware is second to none, I feel, but they need to play catch-up with their OS now. Now, they are still blazing trails. 64-bit and fingerprint recognition will now become a standard.
