What + Infiniti Red Bull Racing has been doing with Webber and with F1 is a shame. I can't wait to see the day they are paying for all the damage. It must be a coincidence that what Ferrari did in 2002 were in Austria, because it seems they have become now the Masters. At least Ferrari didn't put anyone trough hospital with their games.
