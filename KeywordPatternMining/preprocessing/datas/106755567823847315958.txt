So basically I'm paying for other people's Big Macs that I don't even get to eat. How is that fair??
+ Ricki Menace But part of the low price of a Big Mac is borne by society in the form of food stamps.
+ Ricki Menace Certainly if McD paid a living wage to their employees, there would be less of a need for food stamps, and Big Macs would cost more, but probably not a lot more. Personally I think the minimum wage needs to be a lot higher than it is. In MA, it's $8/hr which is above the national average but only slightly. There's a ballot initiative in the works to get it raised and I hope it passes.
