Listened to the show today guys ...good stuff! But + Derrick Story what's a Pentax K-2? Did you mean a K-5 or K-7? Just curious... regardless the 7, 5 (II, IIs) and now 3 are all awesome cameras and deserve respect... kind of like Rodney Dangerfield! Plus the Pentax lenses, especially the limited series, are fantastic!
Looking forward to this review! Sony Canada let me have a run with the RX-1 and the resulting images were stunning!
Hey + Frederick Van Johnson and + Doug Kaye , I would like to add some commentary to your show on the NEX-5R (hope you don't mind... not trying to be smart or anything like that... I just own both the NEX-5R and NEX-6, love them both, and think that this camera format is truly the wave of the future): 1) After using the NEX-5R for the last year, I feel that it's more of a mid-level camera, and would satisfy the intermediate to advanced level photographer given its feature set. Keep in mind that it's currently priced so low (and really is a great deal at the moment) due to it being phased out and replaced by the recently announced NEX-5T (which now has NFC support). 2) Sony will open up it's Camera Remote API for the NEX-5R, 5T and 6, in addition to it's Action Cam and QX camera lines. Follow: camera.developer.sony.com 3) There is a high-resolution OLED EVF option for the NEX-5 series (N/R/T) that truly transforms the camera into a little imaging powerhouse. The EVF is awesome for outdoor shooting and also tilts 90 degrees upward for low angle work (something the NEX-6/7 doesn't do). 4) The NEX-5 series (N/R/T) cameras have touch screen capabilities, again something the rest of the NEX line doesn't have. The touch screen makes it a bit easier to navigate that challenging menuing system. 5) The sensor of the NEX-5R/T cameras have phase detection AF pixels directly on the imager itself, which is a step up from the base D7000 sensor. The Hybrid AF (as Sony refers to it) focuses pretty quick in good light... that along with the 55-210mm telephoto lens, the EVF, it's decent high-ISO and 10FPS burst mode, some general sports/action photography is certainly possible. 6) As for the NEX series numbering... the NEX-3 and 5 series were the first to be introduced back in 2010, along with the NEX-7 following about two years ago, and then the NEX-6 was released about a year back. The 6 has some evolutionary upgrades like phase-detect AF pixels on the sensor and the new hot-shoe configuration that the 7 doesn't have. 7) There is an external mic option for the NEX-5 series... the downfall about all this is that only one accessory (like an external flash, microphone, or the EVF) can be used at one time. This is where the NEX6/7 cameras shine. I am a fan of the Sony NEX cameras, so much so that I now own 5 of them, and they have largely replaced my Nikon DSLRs for day to day use. The DSLRs only come out for any studio or concert photography work. Sony is clearly doing some amazing things at the moment, and they are innovating at a very high rate. I would just like to say to Sony that we now need less camera models, and better/faster lenses and a more rounded system accessory offering (like pro level flashes and maybe even some battery/vertical grips). Great work on the show guys, and a suggestion for the show tag line... "Now get out there and shoot that gear!" Cheers and all the best, Dennis.
Well done as usually Gordon! These are on my purchase wishlist for next year... once the main lenses are available.
