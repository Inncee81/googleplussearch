My first camera for learning how to use a camera properly was a Fuji Finepix S6800 bought in September 2013 - yes, that's right, this 45 year old is just starting to learn the intricacies involved in creating more professional photos. Of course, I have had cameras before to take snaps of the kids, holidays, etc, but the last camera I bought, a Fuji Finepix 6900 Zoom which I purchased in 2002, hadn't until very recently been out of full auto!
