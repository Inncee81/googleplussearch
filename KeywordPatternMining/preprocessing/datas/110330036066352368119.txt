England doesn't have a national anthem
no that is the british national anthem
when uk it is the queen that is sung which is what england has to use rather than its own national anthem
if you don't like it just do what i did and turn it off
seeing that + Rupert Wood kindly provided the link to that setting i've opted out, but if it hadn't been for his post i'd have known nothing of it
I've not received any notifications of it + Rupert Wood
At least scotland has its own government unlike England
it's such a shame that we can't even fly our national flag in England without being branded racist. Scotland, wales and northern ireland all have there own governments yet England doesn't
