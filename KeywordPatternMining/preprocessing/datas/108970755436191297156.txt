+ Richard Tan not sure that matters anymore lol.....motorola mobility is now part of Google which would be reflected in Google's stock.....the motorola stock you are probably looking at has nothing to do with cell phones
+ Sebastian Gorgon actually it's 958...you are looking at closing price not after hours
+ Richard Tan I'm confused are you referring to a Motorola stock price because you said it's down again
What was on the bottom left of the phone? The little dots.
Not gonna lie Verizon can put as many logos as they want on it if they get me the Nexus 5 on their network lol
