I hope that is from the archives, otherwise you see Sydney in a totally different way.
Edit them down first then processe them. Svae so much time.
Please tell me that they did not fly you up there just to test a camera. And if they did I am going to have to give you some competition for your job.
The last one was a load of fun, good to see you running another one.
Great too hear you got in + Natalie Ralston you wont be seeing me though, need to prepare for my street photo workshop the next day.
I prefer the term lens whacking.
also another tip would to use a nikon lens with the Canon body as the canon lens mount is bigger then the Nikon one so you can get the lens inside your body.

I saw some one walking down the street with one of those this week.
been under a rock, first I have heard of it.
I think I will go for one of the bigger brothers, thinking about the x-pro 2 if it comes out. I do like a viewfinder not just because I am used to them but also as I can shoot for longer on a single battery if I don't always have the screen on.
