Not hardly. The A7r is $900 more than the E-M1. The lens will be more expensive. The lenses will also be larger negating the portability factor of the A7. Don't get me wrong, I'm lusting over the A7. But just because they are mirrorless, it doesn't mean they are competing with micro four third cameras.
Hopefully mine will ship this week!
