Interesting... but I'm still not sure that there's anything compelling to make me want to give up my trusty K-5. I don't care about another 8 megapixels - I only care about noise at high ISOs, which I don't think the 24mp is any better at (although I haven't checked in a while.) Better AF (as usual with Pentax) would be the one thing, and it'd have to be a lot better. It would be nice for it to be faster to start video mode, too - I don't use it often but it's annoying that you have to wait 4+ seconds for it to prepare itself to take video.
+ David RÃ¶ll I hope you're right! Only time will tell. Then again, if you're wrong, it will make it easier to feel good about my K-5. Really, the K-5 is certainly an improvement on older systems, but considering that the K-5 has the best implementation of the best sensor, the best build quality, the best sealing, and the best controls and interfaces of any comparable DSLR, it would be nice if it had the best (or nearly) autofocus, too! I probably won't make any move until we see what is coming in the FF field. I'm overall pretty content with APS but I am a high-ISO junkie; if we get the 24mp FF sensor and ISO levels are more than a step better than the 24mp APS sensor, that alone might get me moving in that direction.
Lots of focus points doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be fast, though. I really hope they can finally get it at a modern level, though - although I still have my doubts about just how fast you can get with the SDA focusing in the DA* lenses.
