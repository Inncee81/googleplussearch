+ Sony I just (1 or 2 weeks ago) bought a VAIO pro13 and the shipping say take ages like the last of this month, why is so long? I'm thinking to cancel my order, because it's madness I mean it's a custom one but we all know this "custom" configuration are already there... In stock so why takes so long to delivery? I don't want special timing delivery I just want a normal one, 15 days perhaps!...
