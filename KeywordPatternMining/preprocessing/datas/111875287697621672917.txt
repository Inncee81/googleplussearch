I want a big, fancy cold dripper in our apartment. I think they look great. I've actually been drinking alot of cold filter and pour-over coffee lately. A bit sick of that bloated creamy taste from flat whites and lattes etc
hehe, we have a display shelf in the kitchen which is like at my height, so its even Jen-friendly
