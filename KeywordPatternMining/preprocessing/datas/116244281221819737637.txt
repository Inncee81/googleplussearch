A 6 inch device isn't a phone, it's a tablet with built in 3G. You need to rent a flatbed trolley to haul it around with. I'd rather have a Nexus 7 for tablet duties and a more petite phone that's an easy 24/7 carry.
+ Chad Reyne It's not the size of the uh hands, it's how you use them? Anywy, I just prefer to have a smaller phone that is unobtrusive to carry. I need it to talk on. When I need more serious computing power I carry the (still fairly portable) Nexus 7 which I think hits the sweet spot between usability and portability. The iPad hardly sees any use anymore, it's just too big; it takes a real commitment to haul it and quite possibly a bag.
Oh, and as for the fingerprint scanner thing... the fingerprint is your username, not your password. Ideally, the fingerprint should be combined with a log-on code if you want security. Anyway, even if used as a password it beats what so many people do today - have no security at all.
