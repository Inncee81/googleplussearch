Craig Holmes, from my experience walking the floor at two of the big three that price isn't always the factor. It's also the sales reps who sell their biases. Lol I did a little mystery shopping at one of my other stores and buddy actually tried talking me out of the moto x by saying "Can I change your mind?" The point of the rant is so people know its not just the price point but just as much the sales people. We need change for devices to move!
