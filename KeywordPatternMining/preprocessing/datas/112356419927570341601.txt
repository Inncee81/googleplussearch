Its amazing there selling it for that price point considering the rx1 is like double the price with the evf almost.
They just dropped the price on this bad boy very tempting!
Great photo Frederick!! Love all about the gear but I'm not seeing the video on the Fuji x100s or rx1.
Thanks federick for the link chromecasting it now !
