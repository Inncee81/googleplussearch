I remember when the government didn't put speed bumps everywhere. Its been too long since I visited alt.pave.the.earth.
As far as I can tell there never has been and still isn't any law prohibiting the building of private roads/highways/interstate systems. As I recall President Eisenhower (you know that rabid socialist) saw the strategic importance of the autobahn and decided for the good of us all to start the interstate highway system. So why didn't private enterprise build an interstate highway system? I believe that the history of rail in the US shows us why private roads never would have made the US the industrial powerhouse it is today (just read about it on the Wiki) Here's a fact, one of things that helped defeat the south? Railways that were not inter-connected because they were all private and the Confederate government was opposed to central control and management. Made it very difficult to move supplies/troops around to various fronts. Non-standard rail gauge, etc.
