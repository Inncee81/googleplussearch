Frederick, So Cool been up there many years ago too, I just started listening to your podcasts, I really enjoy them. 9/11 I'll never forget either, today happens to be my birthday. I am stuck in nuetral, I have been trying to decide on a MC, I too am a Nikon Shooter D4, D800, every lens in the Nikon line up. My wife has offered to get me a MC, which one? OMD, Sony, Fuji? Help.
Thanks, Frederick, I'm not going to call you handsome but I think I will take your advice. Is your OMD the new one or the current model?
