Beautiful. I don't remember this one? Was this one of the places you visited after we left?
Oh yes of course. Now that I look at the 360deg image I recognize it. (I was looking on my iphone before so hadn't actually watched it and the "curved river" threw me off. Awesome photo!
I loved the ambiance. I have never heard of this event before. But it looks so beautiful. And you captured it amazingly.
