Glad to have yo watching + Darlene Hildebrandt , + Mike Whitten and + Darla Abernathy ! Mike, you'll always have the interview portion to listen to, and you'll be able to see which words get bleeped (if any).
Sorry 'bout that + Frederick Van Johnson ! I'll put that to the test next time I'm in London + Paul Griffiths , I hope it's now the norm. We have private security here in Canada (Toronto) that do the same, but there is nothing they can truly do about it. Treat them as a person and not an obstacle and you usually have better luck. Glad you enjoyed it + Eric GreauxPhotography ! I was thrilled to be a part of such a great panel.
