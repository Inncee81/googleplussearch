Yes I've been eyeing the Sony line since over a year ago. I'm stoked over the Z1! I may just hop on to T-Mobile if I have to. Judging by ur first pics, I'm in deep trouble. Just look at those nicks on the table!!! Incredible. The rest of the specs is ridiculous too. Keep it comin. Wanna see more of it.
OHHH MY GOODNESS. I AM SUPER ENVIOUS RIGHT NOW. Guess I'll just wait for ur review on the Z1 then. Sigh.....
I have beeeen drooooling over the Z1 for quite some time. My heart stopped with envy when i saw ur post (although it's the Ultra)..... Been using Galaxy since the beginning of time.... first with Nexus (the Galaxy Nexus which was pure crap, Now on Samsung GS3....). Need something new... something different... something Sony!!!!! My entire being is thoroughly bored now with Samsung. I've got a craving for a new face. I think Sony might just do it for me, and the Z1 is definitely, DEFINITELY, the phone I'd run to!!! any idea on when it might be released in the US and if i can EVER use it on VZ. ????? (Please don't break my heart) lol
I am well aware of Big Reds selfish nature. im breaking into pieces! u sure there's no other way around it?? an unlocked phone maybe? (sigh) #desperatelyseekingSony :Äº
