If you wanted to safely raise or abolish speed limits, you'd have to do several things to keep it safe: 1. Nationwide standardized auto inspections 2. Speed governors on cars that are limited to the speed ratings of the tires on the car at the time (changed and locked by the tire installer). Most trucks would be limited to 106mph and most cars would be limited to 112mph (unless you bought tires rated for higher speeds) 3. Actually competent drivers. No 16 year olds behind the wheel. We'd have to have a more thorough driver training program with higher ages like in the UK or Germany. This would include regular testing every few years. 4. Not necessary, but I think safety infractions (you could still be cited for reckless driving for being unsafe/following too closely, weaving dangerously, etc) should be fined as a percentage of your taxable income. Tickets are currently devastating to the poor and a joke to the rich. Many european countries tie the price of an infraction to income, or even net worth. That makes more sense because the people that have more money can buy the fastest cars and can afford to be stupid with them. If we had rules like that, and the police enforced safe driving instead of slow driving, I think things could be faster and safer (and probably more polite, too).
My suggestions were regarding having no set speed limits.
I'm really looking forward to the day when I can tell my car to take me to Denver and I can just sleep and read the whole way.
