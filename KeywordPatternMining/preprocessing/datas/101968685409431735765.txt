This is one of the reasons why I like + App.net 's domain based verification. They just verify domains linked to accounts and let the authority of the domain speak for itself.
+ Addison Todd app.net has about 150,000 accounts now with very high engagement, and is free so long as you have less than 40 people you follow. Now, the environment there might be a bit more hostile to Android sites than most but I do think it's worth it.
