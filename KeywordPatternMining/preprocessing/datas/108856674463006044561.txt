Bummer that it's not the same lens system Lars is on, though I guess the optics must be way different when the sensor isn't as far from the glass.
I don't disagree that kids can benefit from learning to program, but I also think teaching them to use logic to solve problems directly is a great idea. My G&T class did these in like second grade, and I think it helped my logic skills a lot. My regular math class did them in like 8th grade, which seems way too late to me: Making stuff like that more widespread earlier I think would be super cool.
