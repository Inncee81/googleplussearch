We should be able to grow and smoke marijuana without being taxed to death. Why does everyone see it as another way for government to get revenue? They are awful spenders. It's like finding a way for your shopaholic friend who doesn't even try to find a good deal to continue shopping more, instead of taking away the credit/debit card with OUR money in the account. And by the way, i personally do not smoke marijuana
I just think it's hard for everyone to grow what they want to consume just because they need it. I don't grow corn and potatoes, or any of my other vegetables. I go to the market, buy it there, and pay whatever tax is required. I don't see why marijuana smokers should be discriminated against by paying an absurd amount of tax on something that should already be legal. People that eat fast food all day are probably a bigger burden to society, especially those who are obese, yet they aren't taxed to death when they buy their buckets of KFC or BigMacs. + Thomas Schwartz Bottom line, I think the message in the picture is too cut and dry. It makes it seem as if the successful person doesn't already give his share. He/she has already paid the same taxes the others have. Every time they fuel up a company vehicle, they pay taxes that go to those roads. They probably pay a lot more at the end of the year. Instead of looking at us and questioning how the people and businesses pay their fair share, we should look at the government and ask why they haven't been spending our money wisely. This country started a revolution over being taxed, now we're supposed to point the finger at each other over who's not paying enough?
I pay $20/m for 20gb for my Sprint LTE hotspot. That's an employee plan of course, and as of yesterday it was unlimited
