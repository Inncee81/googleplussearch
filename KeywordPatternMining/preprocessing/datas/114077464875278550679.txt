I'm currently paying 70TL ($35/â‚¬26) for 1000 minutes, 1000 SMS and 1Gb of data, in Turkey. And a quarter of that is actually a very unfair form of tax, still yet, Turkcell is one of the most profitable companies here (TKC in NYSE) And for a change, the service quality and coverage is pretty good.
