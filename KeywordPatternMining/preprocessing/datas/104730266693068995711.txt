Who had the Sony Ericsson K700 or K750? If you did do you remember the message alert tones? There was one in particular that I had set and I've been hunting it down since taking ownership of the Xperia Z1. In a personal triumph I've managed to get the notifications and my phone now rocks the message alert 2, just like my K750 did all those years ago. Here's the link to them I'd anyone is interested. https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4dUCXvTtBPjc1VwWWEyS2Fmak0&usp=sharing The simple things in life.......

That was put up as a mistake? Either way it more or less confirms a few rumours on price and looks. For the UK that should be around £280 when released. Source - #android #nexus5
App update - Google Play Music Here's that update for Google Play Music that adds pin icons to cards so you can find music that has been stored on your device with a little more ease. Also included in the update is a new feature called I'm feeling lucky radio. This gives you a selection of music based on what you like. A nice way of coming across new music. The update is now live, comes in at just under 7MB #android
Tesco 4G plans come cheaper than the others Tesco are set to create a little competition in the 4G market, going on price yes indeed they are but in terms of allowances they aren't that different. The Galaxy S4 comes in at £30 per month with only 500 mins, 5000 texts and 1GB of data. Of course if those suit your use then it is certainly a price for you to look at. One other deal breaker could be the O2 network with which Tesco run their mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) on. Current customers can add 4G to their package for £2.50 per month per handset and can be removed if they aren't all that impressed. Tesco also have a very handy data calculator which advises what data package you might need based on how you use it. As for coverage it will work in London, Leeds, Bradford, Birmingham, Coventry, Leicester and Sheffield with coverage in Newcastle, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and Edinburgh arriving by the end of 2013.

SwiftKey release a new beta SwiftKey has come on leaps and bounds since it was first released and has picked up lots of followers. The latest beta has been made available in the form of one apk file as both tablet and phone have been merged as one. Here's what comes in the beta: Compact: On many larger phones it can be difficult to enter text and hold the phone with just one hand. This new feature reduces the width of the keyboard and allows for easier typing with one hand or gesture typing using SwiftKey Flow. It also frees up more of the screen estate on tablets. You can switch it from the left or right side of the screen by a long-press or by dragging. Thumb: For those who like typing on tablets in landscape or wide phones, the keyboard can be split into two areas, enabling fast, comfortable typing with both thumbs. Undock it from the base of the screen for even more flexibility. Full: The traditional full-width keyboard is still available and users with tablets can opt for a layout that is similar to the presentation of a physical keyboard. This layout has left and right cursor keys and the backspace is positioned above the enter key, making it easier to type with two hands when not holding your tablet. All sounds very very good. Get the apk file via the SwiftKey website below: #android
Galaxy S 4 Android 4.3 update rolling out. With KiKat a week or so away any hope of getting it on your S 4 anytime soon as just been quashed with the 4.3 update. Nexus devices have had it for a month or so and most of the changes for the S 4 are Samsung specific: OpenGL 3.0 Support - GALAXY GEAR Support - TRIM Support (Makes the device much faster) - ANT+ Support - Samsung KNOX Implementation (KNOX bootloader and dedicated application) - Samsung Wallet comes pre-loaded - Improved RAM management - Improved Display colour reproduction (Display looks much sharper than before) - Improved TouchWiz Launcher (Much less launcher redraws and less lag) - New Samsung Keyboard - New Samsung Browser (Full screen by default, new tab interface and more) - New Reading Mode (Optimises display for reading, used by only a few specific applications) - New Camera firmware - Minor UI tweaks (Contacts app, Flashlight Widget, dialog boxes etc) As always these updates from Samsung will roll out on a as and when basis, those of you who purchased your device direct from a network might have to sit around for a little longer until they finish messing about with it.

HMV enter the mobile music app space It has been a very uncertain future for HMV, they were very close to disappearing from the High Street completely. What could be a very late step the retailer has now released a music download store for both Android and iOS users. HMV are entering a very busy marketplace, here in the UK we use our mobile devices more so than most with 22 per cent of us making payments on them and 10 per cent using their phones as the main way of shopping. The app will be powered by 7Digital and when you purchase a song or album it will be downloaded to your device. A nice feature involves you taking a snap of an album cover and the HMV app pings you back the option to buy it. It's available via Google Play, you need Android 2.2 and up with 5.4MB of free space. Sadly it isn't compatible with either my Xperia Z1 or Xperia Tablet. The two reviewers though have left 5 stars so it must be good, apparently it's better than Google Play Music. #android #music
Nexus 5 case up on Amazon There have been loads of websites out there posting rumours about the Nexus 5, some have even posted full specs and 'all you need to know' before Google have even announced the thing. It's all about page hits and stats I'm pretty sure Amazon aren't after page hits, just your money. The ad says that it will be available on the 30th of this month so naturally websites are now saying that is when the Nexus 5 will be out. #android #nexus5

Endomondo logs one billion miles Here are some more big numbers from Endomondo, the fitness tracking app. It now has 20 million users, 1 billion logged miles and that's enough to take you to the moon 4,500 times. Interestingly, half of the miles logged come from cyclists, here in the UK they get a tough time of it with people openly putting on social media that they would like to run them over. On the subject of social media, the CEO and co - founder Mette Lykke puts its success down to the fact it is a social app, I see quite a few posting what they've been up to from a walk to car dodging. Well done Endomondo. Here's a press release. Endomondo Fitness App Runs Past 20 Million Users and Reaches Profitability One Billion Miles Logged – Primarily Within Running, Biking and Walking COPENHAGEN, Denmark – Oct. 16, 2013 – The Endomondo Sports Tracker fitness app has reached the 20 million user milestone while remaining a popular, highly rated fitness app across most mobile operating systems. The milestone was reached just as Endomondo celebrated the 5th anniversary of the 2008 launch of its first mobile app. The user base continues to grow steadily across Europe and the United States. Endomondo has also seen increased uptake in South America, Australia and Southeast Asia (Note: Graphic representation can be found at ). Due in part to this expansion, Endomondo confirms it has reached a state of profitability allowing it to maintain operations and development without additional venture capital. The main revenue channels have become the subscription solution, called Endomondo Premium, as well as the paid Endomondo PRO app and advertising. Since launch, Endomondo has motivated users to track more than a billion miles of activity. That equates to nearly 4,500 trips to the moon. More than half the miles logged come from cyclists who have peddled 614 million miles or 25,000 trips around the globe. Running, however, is the most popular fitness activity accounting for 41 percent of total workouts and racking up 272 million miles or more than 10 million marathons. The third most popular physical activity is walking which totals more than 85 million miles. Mette Lykke, CEO and co-founder of Endomondo, said she believes the increased adoption rate can be attributed to the social nature of the service, as well as the addition of desirable features such as the recently launched Training Plans. “Our mission remains to make fitness fun by making it more social and more engaging,” Lykke said. “We constantly listen to feedback from our users and strive to create the best fitness app possible. The fact that positive word of mouth has played a large role in our growth rate really indicates we are headed in the right direction.” For more information, please visit or . About Endomondo: Founded in 2007 by fitness enthusiasts, Endomondo developed a free mobile app that turns GPS-enabled smartphones into a personal trainer and social motivator capable of tracking workouts, analyzing performance, and can aid in the discovery of new activities and insights into fitness so people become and stay active. Endomondo stands apart from other activity tracking apps in its strong focus on social interaction, and helps users connect with like-minded people to encourage the sharing of experiences and support in achieving collective goals. Users can send friends real-time pep talks while they exercise, compete against friends for fun, challenge co-workers, and share it all on Facebook, Twitter or across the Endomondo social network. Available on seven mobile platforms, Endomondo operates on most major smartphones.

You do but you don't get charged anything, Poor old Alex wants to subscribe but his mum thinks it's a scam. #android

Sky Go beta testing going live It's no secret that Sky have left Android users behind with their offerings. Sky Go is dependant on what device you have and Sky News offers their iOS users what has to be one of the best news apps around. As far as Sky Go is concerned there is a little good news. As you'll read below they are getting ready for a full release for a bunch of new tablets. Supported devices will be Samsung, ASUS, Nexus and Sony tablets. Sky will still be testing right through next summer, things like one Android app for phones and tablets. It has been a long time coming but Sky are starting to get support out there. Below is what has been taken from the Sky forums: I am pleased to share our plan for supporting Sky Go on Android Tablets. Given the amount and complexity of the work involved, we are delivering this in a phased approach. This approach will prioritise providing a good quality content viewing experience ahead of UI changes such as making better use of the screen and enabling landscape mode. Phase 1 - Interim Solution for Tablets in progress Creating a tablet specific application that runs on Android 4.0 and above Integrating this application with a different streaming technology that supports higher resolution streams, suitable for large-screen devices Modifying the application code such that it will display correctly on a large screen device [but this will still be restricted to portrait format only at this time] Enabling access to a specific set of Tablet devices that we have been able to test against. Phase 2 - Integrated Solution Integrating the above changes into a single application shared with other Android devices. Removing the ‘Tablet only’ application. Phase 3 - Complete Solution Rewriting the application code to enable it to automatically scale to the screen sizes Developing a landscape implementation of the UI Improved UI Our current estimated timing for these phases is as follows: Phase 1: Customer Beta by end September. Launch early November in progress Phase 2: Customer Beta January 2014 Phase 3: Early Summer 2014 In the Beta trial for Phase 1 our goal is to support devices from Samsung, Asus, Google Nexus, and Sony. The customer beta will be accessible via Sky Go’s Google+ group, and a link will be made available via the Sky Help Forum before the trial begins. As new tablets are launched between now and Xmas, we will do our best to enable access to Sky Go on as many of these as we can, as soon as we can. Thank you for your patience while we worked through the phases outlined above. #android #skygo
Update rolling out to the Z1 and Z Ultra There will be some very happy people in the US today as the Xperia Z1 and Ultra will be available in shops. Here in the UK we've had a little longer with them, I'm on day number 6 and absolutely love the Z1. Sony are also pushing an update out to both devices, primarily touches to the camera on the Z1 and Ultra has had some work done on how the screen responds. Below you'll find a full run down on what will be pushed out to each. For Xperia Z1, we’ve… tweaked the camera algorithm for even better all round performance refined Sony’s Smart Social Camera platform, so Xperia Camera apps run more smoothly (particularly Burst Mode, Superior Auto, AR Effect and Sweep Panorama…) For Xperia Z Ultra, we’ve… optimized touchscreen sensitivity, for both finger gestures and writing / sketching with pencils, metal pens and selected styluses And then across both products, we’ve… re-calibrated the display ever so slightly, to ensure viewing experiences remain bright & bold economised power consumption for longer battery life streamlined Exchange connection for faster email sync, display and download As for when, that will depend on where you are and what network you purchased it through. Safe to say you unlocked and unbranded owners will see it first. Orange and T-Mobile customers in the UK should see it Christmas, 2014. #android #xperiaz1 #xperiazultra

The apps ecosystem is a hugely exciting, but rapidly growing industry, and staying on top of industry developments is key.” #android
Argos gets in on the tablet game Tablets are expected to be big sellers this Christmas and growth of the things is on the rise with children preferring them to smartphones. The MyTablet from Argos will retail for £99 and offer Android 4.2.2 , 1024 x 600 7 inch screen, 1.6GHz dual core processor and 8GB of storage which I'd assume is expandable but at that price possibly not. Compared to some it is far from a top of the range device but the idea is to offer it at a price so they can get it in to as many hands as possible and in particular the 8-13 age bracket. Will it out sell the Hudl from Tesco. This could well be the start of a UK retail tablet war. Who's going to be next? Pink and silver are the colours available, it goes on sale this coming Wednesday.

In the latest update they have fixed the long overdue problems that we have had with the video displaying incorrectly and that pain in the backside moment you go to view the galleries and the app crashes. The update is now live, go get. Hopefully we'll get that super iPad look soon. My Xperia Z tablet can more than handle it. #android

HTC One Max Vodafone UK have got an exclusive on the UK release of the new HTC One Max. It's more or less the HTC One with a bigger 5.9 inch screen and a fingerprint scanner of all things. The screen is 1080p, perfect for films and gaming but when it comes to buying, for those who want something between a phone and tablet it sort of ticks all the boxes. Working away in side you'll find 2GB of RAM, quad-core processors clocked at 1.7GHz seeing it handle high intense games with ease. Keeping it going will be a 3,300mAh battery The 16GB of built in storage can be expanded with a memory card, HTC haven't offered that for a long time. The HTC One max is a Vodafone exclusive from launch, and will be available on a 24 month Vodafone Red 4G-ready plan from £49 upfront and just £47 each month. That’ll give you the choice of Spotify Premium or Sky Sports Mobile TV access, along with 2GB of data each month. Fancy a #4GBonus ? There’s an extra 4GB each month on offer if you sign up before the end of October. You can pick it up this week. #android #htconemax
The LG Flex Here's what looks like the Samsung Round competitor from LG. It's more bent but flex does sound better. As for future advertising, here in the UK they could use that footballer to promote it, Darren. Not much is known about it apart from it comes 6 inches in size and it'll have a release date of November when the Nexus 5 has been and gone. #android
Joining Forces This app has been specially designed by the NHS Trust for those in the UK armed forces. The app focuses on mental health issues with each of the services having their own dedicated knowledge base and info on where to get help. There is no doubt that the armed forces are put in some positions that we would all find difficult, it's good to see that they get the support we would all expect. The app is approved by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and published by South Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. You'll need Android 2.2 and up plus 4.8MB of space. #android + British Army

Is this the Nexus 5? It's all over the internet. Apart from the camera it doesn't look that much different to the Nexus 4. It is seen running key Lime Pie but we all know that #KitKat it's too be the next Android version. I was hanging around for the new Nexus but I've opted for the Xperia Z1, I don't think I'll be regretting it. Originally leaked by mistake I'd say from: #android #nexus5
GTA V, The Manual There is still no news on when the iFruit app will be available for Android, until such a time we're going to be kept occupied with the manual for the hit game. It's a biggy, 181MB and is full of info on all the neighborhoods, game controls and what makes the biggest open world to date tick. There is also a interactive map and a tour of all the activities your characters can get involved with. It would of course be nice to have the iFruit app Rockstar. #android #gtav
Twitter for Android tablets If you've got a Samsung tablet Twitter will look so much better with their new tablet app. Samsung have a habit of getting exclusive with app developers, here in the UK they had ITV Player and the channel 5 equivalent. End of the year seems to be when other tablet users can get hold of it. Ridiculous that only a certain brand in the Android world can have it, in this case the Note 10.1 2014 model. Life is better here on Google+ anyway. Here's the full thing from Twitter: Twitter for Android Tablets will first be available on Samsung tablets, starting today with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1-2014 Edition, and it will come to other Android tablets by the end of the year. We worked with Samsung to include a few unique features: Multi-screen view This new view lets you run Twitter and another app at the same time. Now, you can read Tweets while browsing the web, or check out accounts while you stream music and videos. Twitter widget We’re introducing a widget that brings Twitter content directly to your tablet. The new Twitter widget lets you engage with Tweets, photos, and videos while also delivering country specific breaking news, music, sports and photos. By logging in, you’ll see a more personalized experience where you can interact by favoriting or retweeting right from the widget. Illustrate your Tweets You can now use Twitter as your canvas to create and tweet colorful illustrations, or you can also draw directly on photos from your photo gallery and share them. The ability to doodle also works with the S-Pen, which is available on the Galaxy Note 10.1-2014 Edition. Starting today, Twitter for Android Tablets is on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1-2014 Edition, and soon it will be available on other Samsung tablets as well. Follow @twittermobile for updates, including when the app will be available on other Android tablets. #android #twitteit
Mini Xperia Z1 only in Japan, that's a bit daft?
4G costs set to rise Ofcom are looking to increase the cost of annual fees for licensing the 900MHz and 800MHz spectrum and this could well see the increase passed down to us, the customer. Currently EE, Vodafone, O2 and Three pay £64.5 million a year for use of the 900MHz and 1800MHz spectrum but that could increase to £244.4m. Vodafone and O2 each currently pay £83.1m a year whilst while EE and Three might have a bill of £107.1m and £35.7m per year to access the spectrum. Looking at it like that, I could well see new connections paying slightly more. It isn't a dead cert that it will happen, if it does next year will be when the hike kicks in. Source -

Google Maps update rolling out It may not yet be available over on Google Play but that won't stop you from getting the update. As always Android Police have got their hands on it and had a look at what's new. First up comes new information in the expanded notification area, you'll now see time to destination, distance to destination and estimated arrival time. If like myself you use Google Maps to review places you have visited such as restaurants Maps will now get your to confirm that you want to discard your comments when backing out or editing a review. Before you just backed out and anything you wrote was lost. Now the questions that appear are: Do you want to discard this review? Do you want to discard changes? There are also some big fixes and improvements to how the app works, most of us won't even notice.

Galaxy Round The name is slightly misleading, the Galaxy Curve might be a little more appropriate. This is Samsung's journey in to the curved display race, one that LG are also getting involved in. If you live South Korea you'll be able to get your hands on one, apart from the 5.7 inch screen there doesn't seem to be much known about the specs, it could well be a Galaxy Note but with a curved screen. The official Samsung blog, Samsung Tomorrow is the place to be for more information, if you're interested. #samsung #android
Telegraph app for Android tablets It's been a long long time coming but the Telegraph have got round to rolling out a app for Android tablets. Upon signing up you'll get a free 30 day trial after which a subscription will set you back £9.99, not a bad price compared to The Times. If you use Google Currents reading the news is free but you will miss out on a more in depth analysis of what's going on. Advantages of the digital pack include all the news you'd find in the print version plus interactive cryptic puzzles, crosswords and Sudoku. Chucked in will be picture galleries and video news, the same more or less as the Google Currents edition. Over on their website they are giving away a ASUS Memo Pad for £416. This gets you the 7 inch tab colour of your choice plus a 52 week subscription for £416. You can subscribe via Google Play, it'll be added to your subscription list but this doesn't get you the tablet, the link below does. The app will work with tablets running Android 4.0.3 and has been optimised for the Nexus tablets, Galaxy Note and Tab. It's a free app, download it now. Follow them on Google+, + The Telegraph to get a heads up on the front page. You can choose editions from the past 10 days, to read them simply download them before you head off out the door. The same goes for puzzles and you can always get the solutions to them the following day. At the weekend you'll get all the usual extras, I remember delivering these and other papers when I was a little younger, had to have two bags to get them around and they were so heavy I kept coming close to falling off my bike. Lets hope it works well like the iPad app does and sharing options, Google+ of course would be super. #android #tablets
Chromecast available outside the US We've seen some very over inflated prices on eBay, as always so know this should help put those to bed. Amazon are now offering the wireless streaming device from Google available to UK customers. For around the £34 mark you'll get it signed, sealed and delivered including postage and import costs. Hopefully come the Nexus 5 launch, or even before we and others will be able to order it via Google Play or other retailers. Who already has one? Source - www.androidcentral.com #android #chromecast
Nexus 5 priced? The Nexus 4 was priced super affordable and if the reported price of the Nexus 5 is spot on, it'll be another top of the range handset at a very good price point. According to PhoneArena the 16GB Nexus 5 will feature a 2300mAh battery and will be $299, the 32GB Nexus 5 will be powered by a 3000mAh battery and will be priced at $399. For us in the UK the same price but in British Pounds. Of course this could all be well off the mark. Until release day, only LG and Google, plus some other VIP will be in the know. I'm still very much drawn to the + Sony Xperia Z1 though...... Source - #android #nexus5 #nexus
Homeland special price Season 3 kicked off on Sunday and it looks just as good as Seasons 1 and 2. If you are yet to make a digital purchase of the show Google would like you to bring your attention to a drop in price for Season 1. The HD download is now £ 17.99, down from £24.99 and you can pick the Standard Definition copy up for £12.99, it was £19.99 before. What with The Walking Dead returning to our screens next week, Fri for the UK and this coming Sunday for the US, hopefully we'll see a deal or two there. #android #homelamd #googleplay
Does anyone still use SMS? It'll be cool if Google do integrate it with Hangouts though as it will encourage more to use it. #android #hangouts
The Lady is Risen, the latest free music track available on Google Play. #googlemusic
Skype update on the way Haven't used Skype for a long time now. Google Hangouts is my communication app of choice, has been pretty much ever since it was first pushed out. Skype is still used by many people the world over and if you've an Android tablet you're in for an update to the UI. When the update does hit, later this evening, it'll all be about organising calls and chats with your contacts. Along with that both phone and tablet users will be getting improved video quality and the usual bug fixes. Keep an eye out, it'll be hitting Google Play. Source - #android #skype
Rated People, at last available on more devices. That includes my Nexus 4 and 7.
LG and Samsung to fight it out with curved screens Pop in to a John Lewis store and you might come across a new TV from Samsung or LG that have curved screens. The same technology looks set to be ported to mobile with both Korean firms announcing that they will be releasing phones, in the case of Samsung a 'special' edition of the Note 3 will appear. LG say that the screen will curve from top to bottom, side to side for Samsung. It is also said that the screens will be unbreakable which if true would fix an age old problem for mobile devices. The screen will have a radius of 700mm, be 0.44mm thin and weigh 7.2g which will make it the worlds lightest. Some reckon it will take off, others seem to think it won't. What do you think? LG Display brings innovation to the smartphone market with cutting-edge panel LG Display, the world’s leading innovator of display technologies, today announced that it will start mass-production of the world’s first flexible OLED panel for smartphones. This state-of-the-art panel represents another milestone following the company’s commercial rollout of the world’s first 55-inch OLED TV display earlier this year. “LG Display is launching a new era of flexible displays for smartphones with its industry-leading technology,” said Dr. Sang Deog Yeo, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of LG Display. “The flexible display market is expected to grow quickly as this technology is expected to expand further into diverse applications including automotive displays, tablets and wearable devices. Our goal is to take an early lead in the flexible display market by introducing new products with enhanced performance and differentiated designs next year.” LG Display’s flexible OLED panel is built on plastic substrates instead of glass. By applying film-type encapsulation technology and attaching the protection film to the back of the panel, LG Display made the panel bendable and unbreakable. The new display is vertically concave from top to bottom with a radius of 700mm, opening up a world of design innovations in the smartphone market. And only 0.44mm thin, LG Display’s flexible OLED panel is the world’s slimmest among existing mobile device panels. What’s more, it is also the world’s lightest, weighing a mere 7.2g even with a 6-inch screen, the largest among current smartphone OLED displays. In March 2012 LG Display developed the world’s first 6-inch Electronic Paper Display (EPD) based on e-ink which utilizes a plastic backplane. Having previously showcased the world’s first curved 55-inch OLED TV panel at CES 2013, today’s announcement highlights the company’s leading position in advanced flexible display technologies. According to research firm IHS Display Bank, the global flexible display industry will see dramatic growth and become a USD 1.5 billion market by 2016, exceeding USD 10 billion by 2019. LG Display plans to advance flexible display technologies and bring innovation to consumers’ daily lives with the introduction of rollable and foldable displays in various sizes. #android #lg #samsung
