Wait.... Cnet is more then download.com? ??
I hope 2 things if they do an SDK release. 1: Beta test the OS. That would alleviate the need for a .1 update right after release. Allow people to opt in for it just like a beta for applications. More open then Apple though. 2: They release the SDK with a clear timeframe for device release. I cannot stand waiting like the ChromeCast SDK. Also remember JBQ is no longer with Google... That could be hampering an AOSP rollout.
