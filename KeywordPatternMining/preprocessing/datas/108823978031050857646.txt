I have never understood why people get so emotional and uppity about what other people buy. It makes no sense. If you don't like the product, don't support it. I probably wouldn't use this, but then I don't have an iPad and wouldn't shoot photos with it if I did. On the other hand, there is a similar product, the Beastgrip ( ), that I can't wait for. It's device agnostic and while I'm sure it is too [large, ugly, odd, ...] for many people, I am really looking forward to using some of my old SLR lenses with my S4.
