I tried holding my finger over the flash of my old P&S (a canon ixus) and it just made the entire shot red. Very interesting lighting effect using the blood in your finger. Folded tissues worked fine as a diffuser, though.
It is indeed quite a lovely lens. Almost makes me want to sell my DA 15 f4 and DA 35 2.4, this gives me all the wide shooting I'd need (since I don't shoot wide much anyway) in a single package, and faster. But, I can't afford it even if I did sell them, so down the line perhaps.
While it is awesome for any company to do things like this (they really don't have to) I do dislike such promotions centred around facebook. See so many of them these days. "like us on facebook for a coupon!" type stuff. I miss the old days of simply giving out coupons in certain circles (eg this one) without tying explicitly to one site. May sound very negative of me, but I don't and won't use facebook, even if it means missing out on things like this. And yes, I see they have in-store stuff too, but that doesn't help us rural folk who do all of our ordering online. Still, great for people who can participate.
