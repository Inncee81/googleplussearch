+ Renaud Lepage Well, + Mark Lastiwka pretty much nailed it there. My evaluation of the QX100 is the same as his evaluation of the QX10, except: The QX100 does appear to have an HDR mode buried in Superior Auto (listen for the camera taking multiple shots during a Superior Auto shot). The problem is, it only gets used when the camera feels like it, there is no way to TELL the camera to do autobracketing HDR. On one of my hikes, it got used on maybe 50% of the shots it was needed on. So my evaluation of the QX100 almost exactly matches his of the QX10 - Amazing image quality and optics, but right now crippled with extremely limited software. Things that are desperately needed, which are such a severe detriment to the device I would recommend against buying it until these issues are fixed: 1) There is no way to delete photos off of the camera's MicroSD from the mobile app. You need to plug the camera into a PC with USB, use USB OTG, or pop the card out and into a reader to delete anything. 2) The device appears to have 90% complete Wifi Direct support, but right now, while you can send an invite and accept it with a long shutter press, as soon as the device accepts a P2P invite, the phone's wifi gets really hosed (on both find5 and nexus4). As a result you can only use the existing Wifi AP approach, which leads to very long connection times and an inability to use data and the camera at the same time. Once Wifi Direct support is 100% complete and working, it'll solve a LOT of annoyances with the camera. Overall, in addition to those - yeah the app needs a LOT more added to it. I want at least RAW saved to the MicroSD, what would be epic is a "RAW Develop" mode similar to what Pentax SLR cameras do. (Phone provides a UI for exposure/WB adjustment, but camera's image engine does the gruntwork because it has the power to do so and the phone does not.)
