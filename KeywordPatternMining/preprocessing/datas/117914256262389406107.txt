Welcome news, just in time for release of Kit Kat!
+ Michael Perrigo + Gareth Munoz Guess it's might mean you have not been using cellphones for very long. Google is powerful and offers answers... Internet more than mobile devices, not so much faster as possible.
Eventually going to need to take down the "firewall" and use Motorola to push Android to it's limits. Not inspired by MotoX and hoping for more. Going for "cheap" entry level not a path for success, rather have bleeding edge North American know-how, design leading the way and competing with Apple and Asia for once.
Some kinks to iron out in OS and graphics need a boost. Wish keyboard commands, buttons functioned with screen beyond input of data. Still amazed that it does integrated messaging better than Android or Apple. Playing with a Q10 and Sony Android - big shock going between the two. Still hoping BBM rolls for Apple and Android. Hope they can carve a niche and survive. So Canadian to kick and wish demise of our own.
+ Rogers Communications Live in London, ON - Too many consistent dead spots, minimal to no coverage in shopping malls, speeds nowhere near advertised. Average 2-3 bars strength with LTE everywhere. Funny how bill is there every month, charged for 2-3 times the speed and a supposed reliable network (Same quality service on 2 different devices).
