I have a NEX-5R and love it, it takes amazing pictures. I just wish Sony were better with the apps, it's been dismal. The Direct Upload app is woeful, It's only just got FlickR and still no Picasa Google+ sharing options. My £99 Samsung point and shoot from 2 years ago has far better connectivity, sad to say. and trying to talk to anyone at Sony about it, you might as well be talking to a brick wall.
"Like". It's not Facebook you know... I think the term here is +1
Waiting to pre-order from Argos.
I have no problem with paying for PS+ It's already fantastic value.
There is no guarantee Microsoft won't switch the plan again anyway after they got your money, I would never trust them.
60% failure rate for the xbox360 is not a decent piece of machinery
Guess people believe what they want to believe and filter out what they don't. Microsoft have good products but ask their good products are all software. There isn't a single hardware product from Microsoft I would go within a million miles off.
