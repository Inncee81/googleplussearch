Ey + Jody Barnes it is not too big to fit in your pocket?? I am just thinking in changing my S3 for that Note 3, but the stores in Canada doesn't have them in their show room.....at least with Rogers...
+ Glenn Correa because he had a call....it shows like that when you put that call on hold or do other stuff with the phone, surf in the internet or checking your emails for example...
