I'm stretching here, but curved that way could, in theory, make it hug your leg better when placed vertically in a pants pocket. I at least think there is less chance of snapping the phone if it's curved that way. (At least if we are talking a pronounced curve, not the subtle galaxy nexus version). Either way, waste of time on a phone in my opinion. Would rather see battery life improvements.
On a serious note, could this allow them to make the phone super thin, but still get that hand molded curved shape that people seem to like?
