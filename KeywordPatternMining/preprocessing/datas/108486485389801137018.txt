Hi + Jerry Clack , would love to see what London would of been like with the many trawlers and boats carrying a variety of natural materials into London. Tower Bridge is still a highlight to walk under whenever you get the chance.
Hi + Jerry Clack ! Great post, the shard has become a pivotal landmark within London architecture now. Love the contrast in this picture, it seems even more empowering on a grey, rainy day in the city.
Well if you ever fancy a visit + Jerry Clack , here's our link for the Shard.
+ Jerry Clack What a great photo, the angle of the shot really dramatises the shard. In comparison the poignancy of the statue is heightened by the angle. Thanks for sharing and keep them coming please!!
