Thanks for the mention + Christopher Sequeira . + Suzanne Stewart that is definitely bad form. G+ may even start to mark it as spam and that will increase as moderators begin to do so as well. The only time I know of where that is acceptable is when it comes to circle sharing. Circle Sharers are going to do that and it a common practise but they are sharing to communities that are setup for people to share their circles in.
