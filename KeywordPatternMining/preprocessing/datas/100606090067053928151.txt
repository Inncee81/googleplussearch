LoL, no it doesn't hurt, I love the 6D, but these things are brilliant too.
Ha ha, actually need to find the link first - it's got a stoopid random thing for voting and you can't use the link from the original submission. The whole thing is a mess actually. And my schedule today is photographing a Sunshine Coast wedding, not making sandcastles.
