+ Robert Harwood What are you talking about? Bitcoin has no fees and no middle man. You can use something like coinbase which charges to convert bitcoins to dollars/pounds etc... This wouldn't be required if everyone used Bitcoins though and the US Debt issue wouldn't be happening right now along with other politcal issues not to mention the horrible depreciation of the dollar.
