Personally I like slightly smaller form factors, so I am going to wait for Z1F. I find even the Moto X to be slightly bigger - I would have preferred a 4.5".
+ Stefan Svartling That's a bummer. Did they announce it that way? I must have missed that.
I have been using CBP (thanks to I/O 13) and I also have 13" MBA. My gut feel so far is that if you already have MBA then it's hard to justify chromebook. If you don't and are looking for something new then chromebook makes lot of sense. It will be a perfect device next time I want to buy something for my son (assuming all of his games will be available).
