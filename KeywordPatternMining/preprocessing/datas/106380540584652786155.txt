Sir htc one max is a flop mobile phone after watching so many videos on youtube i am not at all impressed by the htc team, really a old wine with a new bottle. I wish htc should come up a Android phone in budget around 15k to 25k. There is a phone of HTC in 25k to 30k known as htc 600 but to me it's a flop phone. HTC should make a phone like OPPO FIND 5 or some unique technology which no one had made before. Poor htc no one is interested to buy an HTC phone
#HTCOneMax a flop show and copied #Iphone5s technology of Finger print scanner ...
