As I've said on John P's post, I can build a better machine for cheaper than that thing costs.
I have to disagree. I custom built mine. I looked up the specs of this HPZ1. Mine blows this out of the water 5 times over.
+ Marcus Schuff Don't quote me, but I think pricing. The 2.0's might be slightly cheaper to make.
