Doks, you think 50cm would fit me? I can't remember what I ride.
Thanks Doks. I thought as much, but, on the other hand, I'm not averse to playing the clown. I'll think on it...
It' s cool looking, but I didn't Avon made tires. Tires and makeup, strange, but complimentary, product lines. Now all you need is this month's Easyriders and an invite to a Tupperware party.
sickly awesome, dokko. makes me want to devour and regurgitate at the same time.
good to see your box is well stuffed.
