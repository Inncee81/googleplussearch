I'm all for slower speed limits around elementary schools since the younger kids sometimes don't pay attention. I think though that by middle school / high school, they should know to stay out of the road when there's cars and if they don't, well maybe Darwin was on to something.
Drive safe. Looks like the road is infested with semi trucks.
