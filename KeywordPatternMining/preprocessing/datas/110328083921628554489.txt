Holy crap that thread is as long as it is entertaining. And of course useful. Doesn't exactly make me want to stop using public transportation anytime soon (even though that can be risky as well).
If I had an animated gif of someone laughing and facepalming at the same time, I'd post it. #youcantfixstupid
Welp time to mute this thread. Will go downhill from here after that post. #derp #ignorantuneducatedpeople
+ Maicos Cruz Good lord, haha. Learn to use periods dude. You've made yourself look like a total idiot. I mean just looking at your profile is hilarious. Only one post, but a lack of profile use is somewhat common on Google+. The kicker is that it's a textless post, you have your home address there for everyone to see, and it has a one word "conversation" between you and some guy ("Yo". "Yo"). Hahahahahaha.
