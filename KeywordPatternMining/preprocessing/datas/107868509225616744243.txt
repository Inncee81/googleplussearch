I like Note 3 but Sony Z1 screen and speed still better than Note 3 even though Note 3 comes with 2.3 GHz and 3 gig of ram.
I do agree with you. I used note 2 for couple of month then I sold it cause of WiFi drop issue that cause by crappy Samsung motherboard. The funny things that WiFi works better on S3 than note 2
Yep true. But even though Xperia's has some lag actually I used Xperia S, T and ion and does has some lag plus the call quality isn't that good except xperia ion. Perhaps these an old Sony's phone I think right now things it's different.
Okay that's why. I want to buy the Xperia z1 but 2 things I don't like about it - Thicker bezels that reduce the actual screen resolution. - heavy weight ( understand that cause of bigger sensor of the camera) but still love this phone and I heard that Sony leaked some info about the next xperia Z2 hope no more big bezels.
