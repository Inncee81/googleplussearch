I am buying if verizon is selling it
Was afraid of that. Well I could go for a Moto X, but kinda pricy.... Just need something with better reception.
Yes, it looks awesome but I have a cabin way back in the woods where a sliver of a Verizon signals streams in through the trees. At 75 I might need help getting out if I fall cutting wood or such. Otherwise I would just keep my Nexus 4.
