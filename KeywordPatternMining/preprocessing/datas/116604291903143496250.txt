For those prices, these babies really have to do wonders! Both look hot, undoubtedly.
+ Michael Murphy what kind of improvements do you think this camera would need, mate? It'd be nice if you could share that.
Thanks a lot, + Michael Murphy , I believe that this information is quite important to decide whether to get this device or not. As you mentioned, let's hope they take care of these situations eventually.
Somebody needs to tell that redhead to turn her speakers off...
That audio feedback problem is purely related to her having her speakers on, nothing to do with Sony.
+ Anthony Kelly she's obviously watching and streaming her own session while speaking.
Hi + Vivienne Gucwa , thanks for the clarification, that's exactly what I tried to say, and thanks for your feedback on this amazing accessory. To me, this is currently the smartest solution for having high quality photography capabilities in a smartphone, being flexible enough to make it available whenever needed without losing portability or making use of considerable extra resources. So yeah, I'm sold already and will be getting one of these in the short term ;-)﻿ BTW, it'd be interesting to learn how it does at HD video recording.
Now this is the real shit!!! Total respect for Sony!!!!!
Got myself a pair of Sony's XB700's and they're some serious stuff, sharp powerful bass and clear sound overall. I just love them.
+ shalom sam sorry to say this but, so far all you've done is pure whining and little to non action. What you require to do here is take your defective unit ASAP to your nearest Sony Service Shop, along with its warranty policy and purchase order documentation, and they'll take care of the situation as it should be.
+ Shalom Sam LOL!! Okay, dude, whatever you say. Just take it back to the place you purchased it and ask for a refund, that'll probably make you feel better about this whole situation. Fortunately for us, there's plenty of choices out there to pick from. Better luck next time.
