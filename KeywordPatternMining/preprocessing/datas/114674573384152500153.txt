But the title of the article itself is "Getting Your SMS Apps Ready for KitKat" then why these doubts about Play Services? Also, this is quite clear I guess "Some of you have built SMS apps using hidden APIsâ€”a practice we discourage because hidden APIs may be changed or removed and new devices are not tested against them for compatibility. So, to provide you with a fully supported set of APIs for building SMS apps and to make the user experience for messaging more predictable, Android 4.4 (KitKat) makes the existing APIs public and adds the concept of a default SMS app, which the user can select in system settings."
