+ Liam Spradlin I went with black and I kind of regret it now. I think I would have been happier with white.
That doesn't even make sense. There's no buttons on the front. You're making that statement because it's shiny white (you know, GLASS) with a colorful wallpaper with a time and weather widget. That could be used to describe any of a dozen other devices. Meanwhile, the bezel is raised and the camera is offset so it will work well in landscape or portrait.
Except you don't have the "overall look of the device" in this shot. You have a head on shot. The back of this tablet looks nothing like a Samsung product, so your previous statement doesn't stand. Additionally, you're judging a device on the wallpaper and the widget? Can you think of a more ridiculous set of credentials through which to judge something?
If you had clicked the link and seen the other photos in the article you shared, I think you would have had a different initial opinion.
God I'm so sick of this shit.
Dude, seriously, mis-matched socks are cool now. Let her pick her two favorite princesses and rock it like that.
I'm telling you man, you'll live longer if you just let it go.
My son does it too with Cap and Iron Man. Let it pass, bro. Deep breaths.
The only time my socks are matched are when they are my toe socks
