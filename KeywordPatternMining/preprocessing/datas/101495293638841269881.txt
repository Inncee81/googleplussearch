Really gutted I can't make this, but if anyone could still answer a couple questions I have that would be awesome: Do Sony have any plans to make the QX10/100 compatible with any other OS's such as Windows Phone? I currently own both a Nexus and a Lumia 920, and would be really interested in the QX10 or QX100 but as the 920 is my "Daily Driver" (as + Marques Brownlee would say ) I am rather disappointed that it would not be compatible. Can you please comment on any of the rumours of the Sony Xperia Z1 Mini? I for one am very interested in this device and would love to hear more about it if it is real (and if it isn't real, MAKE IT SO!!!). I love Sony's devices and think the Mini would be a great premium smartphone for the masses of people who think the Z1 is too big and might otherwise go for the iPhone or HTC One Mini. (I don't even care if it has an inferior processor/camera, just make it a good phone in a decent, ergonomical size!) Thank you for your time, I know this was a long post! All the best.
