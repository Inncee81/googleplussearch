Ya know what's really really important in a phone? To be able to make a call from anywhere to everywhere. I was lost overnight on the logging roads in Maine, north of Baxter State Park. My analog brick phone worked. It worked when I had to overnight a mile from the summit of Mount Washington. Now, my Droid 4 can't send or receive a signal from Trumbull Center. Forget the bells & whistles. I want to make a phone call.
