Played the Lego Marvel Super Heroes Demo the other day, just as entertaining as previous Lego games. Titan Fall I think is going to be really good as well. Yeah, having only 5 exclusives doesn't add a whole lot to the xbox one experience I guess. Was the same situation when I got my first 360.
That's what I liked so much about the first Resident Evil game, it was full of unexpected surprises.
+ The Old School Game Vault The game was so unpredictable, but some of the later versions were almost too predictable.
Yeah, I guess if too many people can access the games for free, then many wont buy them is the problem. They did say you would be able to access your accounts from other consoles, so its not all bad, just cant be logged onto 2 consoles at once is all.
+ The Old School Game Vault Still, 5 was a good number, better than zero lol.
Interesting how you stated Infinite has evolved more into an FPS, I'm still yet to play this myself. The first time I played Bioshock I just about lost my sanity. Its such an odd world its hard to grasp. The cool part is, its those oddities that make it suspenseful, because you never know what to expect.
+ The Old School Game Vault It was the creepy story that kind of drew me in with the first game myself. The whole game was like a giant puzzle. As if we've woken up in a strange world and don't know what to do. They had that concept down with BioShock!
+ The Old School Game Vault speaking of creepy, it looks like there might be a Left4Dead 3 game coming soon.
I like how Megaman has been implemented in so many alternate games. They even put Megaman into the Marvel vs Capcom series.
+ The Old School Game Vault Mighty No. 9 is going to be off the hook!
