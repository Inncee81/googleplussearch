One day out, and already made news here in Boise.
A friend posted it on his news feed this morning. You have kicked up a small hornets nest locally. Some people are very pro-police, some are very anti-police. I think a lot miss the liberty angle.
Another article. Curious about why our police are getting a reputation.
Hey, my in-laws live in Freedom, Id. There is a lot of color in the Soda Springs area, I am told.
More on the story: The Boise Guardian is a long-time local blog. He is pretty thoughtful. I thought you may like his take. He also posted about the video a few days ago. This is his response now that the controversy has kind of died down.
