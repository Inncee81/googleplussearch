-I've had no problems with key register speed on the Google keyboard. -My home button gets slightly crooked, but I don't notice it, probably because I have the white phone. -I've used GPlay Music a lot since getting it and the delay doesn't seem any longer to me. Change your notification ringtone, that's probably the issue - it has a long wind-down time. -Camera focus is indeed a bit off, but generally performs fine for me. It's also still an outstanding camera for still photos. And hey, slow-mo or high-FPS video that's hardware encoded. Try the 60FPS 1080p - it looks crazy. -Auto-brightness has always been broken on Samsung devices. It's stupid annoying. -Yeah, the volume rocker is too high now that I think of it. -Battery life has been hit and miss for me as well, probably mostly because of Sprint. Android System is the one that eats all my battery, though. Keeps the phone awake constantly it seems. -Speaker is the same module as the S4 but sounds quieter because it's got a smaller hole to come out of now. Looks better, doesn't offer any real advantages. -Meh. At least it's not LG's UI. -Tons of phones have issues with disabling apps that the OEMs flag as non-disable..able. It's dumb. -Yep. I just keep the search / now widgets on my homescreen. -Pretty much. Turned them off immediately on mine. Easiest way to find an old person using a Galaxy phone - listen for the droplet noise. -Er, mine definitely only vibrates for some notifications. Not sure what your issue there is, unless you constantly have the phone on vibrate only.
OJ didn't do it guys, he was too busy fabricating the Nexus 5 service manual with the ghost of Lee Harvey Oswald after they stole Nikola Tesla's time machine.
