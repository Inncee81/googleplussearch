that had to be fun. Good thing they're both designed for off road use
damn 450 HP in that thing is crazy. Looks really nice but definitely a sleeper rocking that much power.
interesting... I'm with you though on more diesels need to come to the states. Within the next year I'll be buying a new car and if Subaru brought the Forester diesel to the states I wouldn't have to start considering what I'm going to buy next. But driving over 35K miles a year I need good gas mileage
I imagine the colors were awesome on this one but I think this treatment worked perfectly on this photo
I remember them. This one did stand out in that album but I think I like it a lot better in this style
I'm with you. There's always a place in my heart for a slammed dually, and I agree the semi rims are the perfect touch.
pretty sweet how you got just about every wing position for landing in one shot
