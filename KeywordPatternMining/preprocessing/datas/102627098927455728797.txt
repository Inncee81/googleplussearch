+ Bok CHoy I'm all for increased access to public mental health care and reform of our criminal "justice" system, but you're creating a false equivalency between guns and knives, explosives, infectious biological agents, etc. There are practical reasons that guns are overwhelmingly the weapon of choice for those seeking to kill other people: 1) They're relatively easy to obtain 2) They're easy to use 3) They're highly effective While all the things you mentioned certainly can be used to hurt or kill people, none of them fulfill all three of these requirements as thoroughly as guns.
+ Darren Eskandari "Evil intent is easily tempered by a lack of opportunity" That's exactly the point that makes me /facepalm every time I hear someone recite the old "people kill people" saw, though I'm not sure the word "easily" belongs in there. + Andy Wise Addressing mass murder and addressing gun violence in general need not be mutually exclusive. Taking action with regard to so-called "assault" weapons need not preclude action on handguns, which are by far the more common implements of homicide.
+ Andy Wise I'm not in favor of an outright ban for any particular kind of weapons (e.g. handguns); when I say "take action", I'm suggesting that modifications to licensing and training/certification rules, controls on distribution and sales, record keeping requirements, and any number of other things could help contribute to a reduction in unlawful gun violence.
