Agreed, but the question is, how much of the experience is really locked down with parental controls? An 8 year old can be pretty resourceful and I bet there are plenty of parents that just aren't, when it comes to computers.
I hear you Jonathan and I'd hope your level of security is the majority, rather than the minority. I have a 13 yo and a 16 yo. The 13 is locked down to an under PG13 rating and the 16 is basically TV14-M sort of level. We have software on all their devices, though mobile is a challenge. Any tips on best Android apps for this would be great.
