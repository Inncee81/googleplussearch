I like how you sent yourself money! Support + Cali Lewis by sending her money!
I feel your pain! I also have sleeping problems. I would try staying up later to see if you can push your body to sleep past the 2 am mark. Also, maybe do some good excercise several hours before you want to sleep. You want to make sure you have time for your heart rate to drop to normal. I find that an elevated heart rate keeps me awake. Let us know if you make it out alive! We are rooting for you! You can do it! (And you will !)
Do you have one for Brother MFC units? We don't use Canon printers at work.
