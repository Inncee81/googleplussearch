Does G+ have 1B users? Maybe. The bigger question is how many are active? We had to get cell phones for the boys because the school district built a new STEM school. In order to download apps from Google plsy store, they had to have Gmail accounts. They automatically got G+ accounts. They do not use social media. So, there are four inactive accounts. All Youtube people are now forced to have G+ accounts. Many do not use them.
Thank you, + Stefan Svartling . I will definitely try this.
