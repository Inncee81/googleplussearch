You dont need a screen protector. It just ruins the phone's screen and touch.
+ Eric Witrigs Its got Gorilla Glass 3. I've owned the Note, Note 2 for 2 years. Never put a scratch guard / cover on any of my phones. Doesn't make sense to me to use a downgraded experience on the phone for a year, just because I'm going to sell it at some point. Thats the way I look at it.
Got the Note 3. Wont get the Gear.
