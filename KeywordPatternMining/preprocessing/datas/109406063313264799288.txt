Ah Steve, it's like you're talking directly to me about the A7r. I have some great M glass I got about 10 years ago, and no digital M body because Leica priced me out. I only got to start using my M glass digitally when I got a NEX. As soon as my budget allows, I'll probably jump at the A7r for slow things, and keep my Canon SLR for fast things.
