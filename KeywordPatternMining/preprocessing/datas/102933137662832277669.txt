Nice devices, but that's a little too much Cheese Wh...er, I mean TouchWiz in one place for me.
+ Alexander Maxham I guess TouchWiz won't be a problem if/when the Google Experience Launcher is released. The only other main problem I have with most Samsung devices running Android is their insistence on using a combination of hardware and capacitive buttons (both of which are, imo, behind the on-screen buttons Google is pushing forward).
+ Scott Abramczyk TouchWiz bothers me in a couple of different areas, all revolving around the design itself. Firstly, the design change from stock "Google Experience" design standards are done simply for the sake of change and to differentiate themselves from Google, or any other Android device manufacturer. Pointless, in other words. Secondly, the design changes that are made aren't nearly as aesthetically pleasing, at least not to me, than "stock Android". If they had taken Google's design and made slight changes to add their own little flair, it would be different, but Samsung has felt that they need to change every icon Google has designed (that isn't actually a Google-specific app) and completely redefined its entire UI. Samsung is increasingly moving more and more to be like Amazon, who takes the Android core and tries to replace everything Google with their own design/apps (store, mail, voice, calendar, etc.).
