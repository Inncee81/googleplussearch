I absolutely adore my D800 for it's resolution, tonal transitions (aka Nikon's processing), autofocus speed and it's almost telepathic metering system - so the A7R would really need to be a clear winning in those areas (and have the general primes to match Nikkor's range), but it's certainly one I'll be keeping an eye on. Interesting times indeed. Edit: I've just read on SAR that the "A7r has [a] 36 Megapixel [sensor] with no on sensor Phase detection..". So whilst that's fine for those wanting to shoot still life, portraiture and landscapes, it's likely a little too slow for folks wanting to capture a moving target, but there's hope that we may see it in the next iteration. The lower spec'd A7 with it's 24Mpx sensor does on the other hand feature the faster phase detection AF built into the sensor.
+ Gabriel Campos This is an educated guess at best, but given that the D800's 36Mp sensor was the product of a joint development effort between Nikon and Sony, it seems likely that it might also make an appearance in a Sony model - the A7r in this case. The A7's 24Mp sensor with PDAF is already in production and comes straight from the a99, so it may just be that Sony have also opted to use another pre-existing sensor in the form of the D800's 36Mp sensor to further keep dev costs down rather than re-engineering PDAF into it. Either way, D800 IQ in a travel friendly body with Zeiss optics sounds pretty tasty.
My D800 seems to push my i7 3700 series w/ 16GB ram and 520MB/s SSD pretty hard, so perhaps opt for something with similar specs or better specs if you're dealing with PS files that can grow past a gig in size. Frankly though the system part is the easiest of choices to make, the hardest decision for me was selecting a monitor with the greatest and truest colour representation I could find for a reasonable price and settled on the Asus PA248Q in the end.
