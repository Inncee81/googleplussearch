David, great!! Have you seen the light? (smiley). Really, long time the best lenses had from Nikon and my latest was the D3s. Even with 2 Zeiss, the 21mm Distagon and the 100mm planar macro. Really great lenses. But now very satisfied with all my Fuji stuff. Still have the metabone converter for the Nikon here, Trying to sell it. And waiting for the 23mm 1.4 Regards peter. Now I'm going to try to upsize my file's ðŸ˜ƒupsizing or interpolatie or something.
