I went on the hike there in June. Skaftafell is a very beautiful area
I highly suggest summer, since I heard many tourists go in the winter to see the northern lights, but usually even during the 21 hours of darkness it's still cloudy so you can't see them
And the weather and daylight in summer are wonderful
And Im not sure about the crystal caves
