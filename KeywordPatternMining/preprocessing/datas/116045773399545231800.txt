+ Stefan Svartling , I'm with you. I gave this about 15 whole minutes. It would have to get really smart in a big hurry to live through any learning curve. I have multiple screens, folders and widgets and with these building blocks I have a screen for the use cases of my life. Add in Google Now monitoring everything else and bringing it to my attention, I'm good! Last thing I need is to train or worse yet, fight an app trying to "help" me.
