If the revealing was on the 18th, press would have already received their invititations to the event. I'd say there's less than 1% probability they would make the announcement without an official press event, especially given the kitkat and all.
So far it looks like a lot of important under the hood changes in the right direction are being made in kitkat, which is just what android really needs right now. Major decoupling of apps was actually my biggest hope for a long time, the resulting modularity maybe one day allowing OEMs to one day add only user replacable modifications, and everyone being able to go back to stock experience without flashing anything. Next on the list would be more granular app permission and battery use control (which the hidden app ops from 4.3 suggests to be likely), which is probably the one thing worth copying from iOS. Right now, IMHO, it's Android's single major pain point.
This is nice, but what I'd really like to have is the option to allow only specified apps access to GPS sensor...
It definitely should, before becoming the default version. I think they should have gone the same route for Android app makeover, Google seems to be the only major app developer not utilizing PlayStore's beta channel feature, which would serve them well.
