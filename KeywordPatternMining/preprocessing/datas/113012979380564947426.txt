I actually decided to hold off and wait for this. I have a $200 Wal-Mart gift card so I'll cop it from there.
This thing has a lot of advantages as a tab. The Q-Slide features on a bigger screen will be really awesome and 7 is a bit too small and 10 seems a bit too large so 8.3 you could still take on the go. Oh and Full HD IPS? Yes please.
It's gonna come down to Black Friday or Cyber Monday pricing for me lol
LG hasn't made a tablet in years but had made four banging ass phones in the last year. This is based off that last phone which is arguably one of the best phones out and it's priced right between the Nexus 7 and the Note 8. Slam dunk LG.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't kicking around the idea of getting a Tablet that can do Android and full Blown Windows also.
Root and flash makes that a non issue. I rely on devs.
If you say so man. I been doing this since Android was a thing. I love my HTC One with Sense and with AOSP.
I may have to cop one.
I think I'm about to cop a HP Slate 7 with Beats Audio just for lounging around the house.
I used airplane mode once in my whole life and I was on a airplane when I did it.
Wow no wonder I don't use the site ever.
Actually I agree on the price being right on time. I can't wait to test this out.
Will Wal-Mart carry this at all? I have a $200 gift card there lol
Would be sweet if I could use my gift card and get this for $150 lol
I watched the game tonight. Good game. They didn't get that grand slam but got 5 runs that inning instead lol
