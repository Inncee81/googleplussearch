Ass-ass-ins Creed. Fukket. I was pissed too I had that game paid off as well as my PS4.
Killzone and inFamous. MGSV hell yes. The only retro game I like is probably Super Metroid. And a whole bunch of Super Nintendo shooters like Axelay. Contra III...but I played a couple of retro games the other day on my Vita...felt like throwing up.
I can see you playing video games until you get arthritis.
