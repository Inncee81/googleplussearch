#delete5 agree + Jack Johnson who agrees + Nev Nels . You have a great picture, but top and bottom are separate pictures I think. I like the colors of the bottom. and I like the fly of the bird on top. Did you shoot one 5 minutes later ?
+ Max Kotchouro my bad, I thought it was an evening fog so did you take one 5 minutes earlier ?! ;) and now I want to change my vote (yes I can !) so #save8 because now I see the light (...) that bring your eyes to the bottom and all the birds
