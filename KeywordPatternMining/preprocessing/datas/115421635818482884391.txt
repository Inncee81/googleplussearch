I hope it does happen. We need another venue in the US!
Yes, + Nick Griffin We could use one here.
As far as I can see, we'll have to wait until 130 a.m. Soccer takes priority over F1 on NBC. I don't understand the reasoning behind this, especially when NBC has many other channels.
Everyone, you can watch qualifying live tomorrow at it's scheduled time, if you have DIRECTV. You will need a subscription to channel 455, UniVision Deportes HD. The listing is showing a 8:55 a.m. (eastern time) start time, ending at 10:00 a.m. During todays FP2, Leigh Diffey said that if the Americas Cup wrapped up today, NBC Sports will move the qualy up to 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. You can also download the NBC SPORTS EXTRA app, probably my best option, and watch the Live Stream. I hope this helps everyone, and join me in wishing someone, somewhere hears this plea; WE NEED A PROPER MOTORSPORTS CHANNEL, ALA THE DEFUNCT SPEEDVISION, not the NASCRAP centric SPEED TV. PLEASE!
