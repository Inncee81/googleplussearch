I find your review suspect.. Here's why. -The GX7 body only Price is $899.99 compared to the EM5 initial price of $999.99, yet you gave the E-M5 a better value score. You also gave the E-M5 a better IQ score, when you said the GX7, E-M1 and the E-M5 have the same IQ, even when matched up to RAW. You also should have mentioned the plastic top panel is used for the WiFi/GPS to escape and you have the score for Handling TIED? One of the biggest Gripes of the E-M5 IS the Handling!! Many complain that you need to Pay for the Extra Grip for the E-M5 to handle properly... I like your Reviews, but this one is Poor.
One other thing to add... You complain about the "Black Bars" in the VF for the 4:3 view, however you still see 100% of the image, unlike the VF of the Canon 6D...
