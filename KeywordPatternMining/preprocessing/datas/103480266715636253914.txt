I'm going with the opinion that this photo has been altered. I'm not a professional photographer so I'm just going to point out from a lay-man's observation... First - the light source that could possibly be above and behind the camera puts a clear shadow on the gentleman in the foreground; should the sam angle of shadowing be consistent with his legs and feet also adjust for the further down-angle that the shadow would be casted? Secondly - the gentlemen are standing around in the outdoors where it also appears that there is natural lighting being intermittently blocked by natural fauna. Would they not also have the fauna shadowing on themselves? With that being said, shouldn't they be casting shadows also from the sunlight regardless of the fauna? Would like to hear the opinions of professional photographers on this one!
