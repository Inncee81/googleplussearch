If you ensure your left thigh is touching your right thigh while you cross, it should be safe. Being able to wear such a tight dress nicely is something to be proud of, I don't see why anyone has to avoid it. The ability of moving around presentablely in it is elegance. That's what I think at least ;)
I've seen them in some shops in hk, is cool to have one at home, but might not be very child friendly?
Thanks + ZheWei Sim the present on YOUR birthday
