How is this better than my Black Rapid? I can't imagine trying to clip the D800 with 70-200/2.8 to my belt or anything else. Even the 24-70/2.8 combo is heavy. What happens if you go to clip it and you miss? I can't miss with the Black Rapid strap. These are serious questions too. I'm not trying to be a PIA. ;)
+ Gino Barasa Thanks for the extended writeup and sorry for my late reply. I have been up to my ^^&^%&#$ in work. Anyway, there is something about having close to $6,000.00 worth of gear tethered to me that brings me comfort. Yah, I hear you about the blowing ball swinging wildly about my nether region. That can be a pain and I have done it while hiking on Mt. Rainier. Not fun. Equally not as fun would be dropping the D800 with 70-200/2.8 attached. Well, I may check this thing out if I ever run across it in Glazer's or wherever. Thanks again.
Nice one! I thought for a second that this might be my street car. I shot this last year before I got my D800. It was hand-held and in the night while standing in the middle of the street trying not to get ghosted. https://plus.google.com/114548661351730516495/posts/Sg9brL2Zn7A
Really great capture. Love the perspective and processing too. I never ate at this place, but walked by it a couple of times. Now, I wish I had stopped for a bite.
Awesome dude... really digging these shots. I spent 4 days in a hotel at the end of Canal St. I haunted the FQ on a daily basis and fell in love with it. My morning experience was a bit different. One morning, I had a guy walk up beside me while I was taking photos, unzip his pants, and proceed to relieve himself on the front bumper of a pickup truck. LOL We were no more than five ft. apart. Probably would have made a great shot.
Jackson Square? Right in front of the cathedral?
Love these shots of Nawlins. Takes me right back! I don't miss the heat though. ;)
