Perfect timing and a great composition. + Frederick Van Johnson Did you use film camera or mean it was video recorded?
+ Frederick Van Johnson Love the film and the look. The F4 is a great camera. I have the F3 which I love also. I think I heard you mention you shot with the military F3 version during your military days.
Can't wait to get my hands on GX7. Looks to be a great m43 camera.
+ Frederick Van Johnson Please give us your thoughts and feedback on the GX7 on the next TWIP / Gear episodes!
