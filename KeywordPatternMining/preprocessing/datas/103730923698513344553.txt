Puffins come ashore in Scotland from late April (some may be later in the north and west) until mid-August. July is the peak month to see adults with beak-loads of fish coming in to feed chicks. Some of the best places to see them are the Treshnish Isles off Mull, Handa in west Sutherland, Hoy in Orkney, Noss and Hermaness in Shetland, the Isle of May in Fife and the Farne Islands just across the border in Northumberland.
