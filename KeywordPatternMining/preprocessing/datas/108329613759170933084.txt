+ Alexander Maxham + Keith I Myers I think Alex needs a good ass whipping!
+ rob horton I don't understand people's complaints about battery life. Even Alex said that he can get 15-18 hours on his Note 3... There are very few times where you need more than that. It's it that tough to plug it in while you sleep? So what if you have to charge it every night!
