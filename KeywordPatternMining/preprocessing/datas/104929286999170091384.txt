Sony Mirrorless Full Frame- the Future of Photography? In case you hadn't already seen it, here are some thoughts on the New A7 and A7r.
Sony Mirrorless Full Frame- the Future of Photography? In case you hadn't already seen it, here are some thoughts on the New A7 and A7r.
Sony Mirrorless Full Frame- The Future or Photography? I love gadgets. So it's no surprise that I make it pretty clear what I'm using, and occasionally, what I find intriguing. About a year and a half ago I bought my first modern digital Interchangeable lens camera and as I detailed here, I chose the Sony NEX system. Sony is a company that has shown a willingness to push the boundaries. Here are some examples: Release of the NEX (First mirrorless APS-C system), RX-1 (First Full Frame fixed lens Mirrorless camera), Focus peaking system, and the Alpha SLT system. They make the sensors used in Nikon's flagship Full frame cameras and the sensor used in the iPhone 5 and 5s. So, with the release and subsequent success of the RX-1 it isn't that much of a surprise that Sony is only a few days from releasing an interchangeable lens Full Frame Mirrorless system. It will use the same lens mount as the NEX system and the first 2 models will carry a center-mounted Electronic Viewfinder. Digicame-info.com posted a couple photos which have been confirmed by Andrea at Sony Alpha Rumors. To my eyes, the camera looks like a hybrid. The body and top controls are like an RX-1, the grip and mount are from the NEX bodies, and the hump on top of the body for the EVF that looks like an old school pentraprism box. There have been quite a few exceptional photographers that have moved to mirrorless systems as their primary kit over the past couple years. Trey Ratcliff recently started using the NEX 7 for his epic landscapes. Zack Arias is a hardcore Fuji X series user. TED photographer Duncan Davidson has been using the RX-1 as his main camera for day-to-day use. Aaron Courter, who is an exceptional Portland based photographer and a long time friend has been incorporating the Fuji X cameras into his personal work, wedding and portrait business with great success. I'm in love with the Sony NEX. I never even considered a DSLR camera because of the size, the weight and what I perceived to be its imminent demise. Up until now, you couldn't really get the same image quality and crazy shallow depth of field from a mirrorless camera, but I think the A7 and A7r will be the start of a large scale move away from large DSLR bodies for most photographers. Sure, there are some times when the larger camera really makes sense. The Mirrored design still allows for faster focusing in sports contexts and there is certainly an expectation in event photography that will take awhile to pass. In addition, the larger bodies do have many features still missing from the new breed of mirrorless cameras and certainly handle big glass much better. This is a moment. It feels like the rise of ultra portable notebooks such as the Macbook Air which have almost negated the need for more powerful desktops for all but the most demanding of users. I believe we are witnessing the birth of the future of photography.
Great comments guys! Thanks for your thoughts and for the shares. + Andrew Clitheroe regarding the Evf, there are some really cool things like magnification, true wysiwyg composition and focus peaking that just aren't possible with an optical viewfinder. They Are also great in Low light or in bright light because you. An see what the sensor sees + Roger Madsen dsen, on the Leica front, they of course already make a ff model, the M. For the majority of folks however, using a range finder isn't really preferred. If you are going for the aesthetic and the layout, the Fuji x models have a Leica vibe. I don't know about the The Sony A7, but the NEX 7 is smaller than a Leica. + Joel Coulson , + Gabriel Campos , I too think the d800 is amazing. Hopefully it's not long before they figure out how to get all (or most) of the awesomeness from a camera like that into a smaller body. They have to figure out a great way to do the sort of phase detection and focus tracking Dslrs do but without the mirror. Next version maybe? As far as iq? If the rx1 is any indicator, I bet it's already there if not Better.
+ Andrew Clitheroe , I see what you're saying. I've found the Evf on my NEX to be just as capable in true low light situations. It is more lacking in almost no-light situations such as Astro photography though. You are right that an Ovf makes more sense for that for position and focus.
I've got a 35mm f/1.8 lens that I'm looking to sell. Just listed it on ebay. This one is in great condition and has been my primary walk-around lens for the last 6 months. Let me know if you are interested or just go check it out there.
Ahh...I hadn't picked up the Zeiss 24 yet.
CREPUSCULAR RAYS First post to this group. I'm a sucker for sun beams breaking through the clouds. AKA Crepuscular rays. Sony NEX 7, 24mm, f/7.1, ISO 100, 1/1600, Lightroom
Just posted my review of the + Think Tank Photo Mirrorless Mover 10
Hmmm... I couldn't speak to that combo. The largest lens I have is the kit 18-55. It just barely fits with the hood on, but it's pretty tight.

"Chozo Monoliths" A unique take on the monoliths at Smith Rock, Oregon. When the river's water level is lower after the spring melt, these smoothly-eroded basalt rock formations reveal themselves. It's not easy, nor is it pleasant, reaching them. Some pretty decent light occurred while I was attempting to find a way out to this spot in the river. I didn't expect to spend as long as I did finding a composition (hours), so it turned into a twilight shot. I think it works well due to the strange and perhaps otherworldly nature of the foreground. Thanks to + Michael Bollino and + Alex Mody for turning me on to this area of the park in the first place!
Yeah, I'm kinda hoping I have a good reason to head over there sometime soon.
Great article + Trey Ratcliff ! I've been a NEX user for the past 1.5 yrs and like many have mentioned already, could kind of see this change coming. It's hard not to, when the images you are posting coming from the NEX 7 are clearly equal with the stuff coming out of your Nikons. Thanks for being so open with the process, and gear that you use. I stopped by your site just last night before heading out to shoot fireworks and it was a big help!
Master planning in Beijing... I'm enjoying this Sony NEX-7 experiment in China... I'm keeping copious notes... the plusses and the minuses... will compile a full report after the trip, but for now, here's a shot from the middle of it. If you missed the background on the experiment, see
Kah-Nee-Ta Sunset Spending a couple days at Kah-Nee-Ta with the whole family. The Sunset lit up the whole valley and we were luckily out by the hot tub when it happened.
Here's my review after 4 months with the Sony NEX 35mm f/1.8. A little nerdy, and gear centric, but in the end, this is the lens that has become the center of my one camera, one lens daily M.O.
Popsicle Love this shot of my middle son, Gavin. First upload here from my new body. Moved from the Sony NEX 5N to the 7 so I'm using my same go-to lens the 35 f/1.8. This is a classic example of the pitfalls of shooting wide open at close range. The closer eye is a little out of focus. I need to work on that aspect of my composition.
Beach Reflections Lightly sharper version of the photo of this photo I posted yesterday...
This is a view from my commute home. 3 shots with 2.0 EV between each exposure merged in Photomatix. Trying to capture the huge contrast and feel of the sky without going overboard on the HDR thing. This is awfully close to how I remember it.
Was out in Denver for a business trip last week and had a great chance to get out on the town with my camera. Larger images are available here-
New to the group, but not new to G+. I'm an avid 5N user and I shoot with the 35mm 1.8, 50mm 1.8, the Kit 18-55mm and a couple vintage Olympus OM mount lenses. These photos are from 2 evenings last week on a business trip to Denver CO.
Smeared Steel Bridge I usually take the Hawthorne bridge when heading home, but yesterday, I could just see a bit of color leaving and wanted to get on the other side of the river a little quicker so I took the Steel Bridge which is a little closer to my office.
A few weeks ago I made it out to a new location for me, Jonsrud viewpoint in Sandy. I'd seen images other folks had created from here (esp + Gary Randall ) and it's really only about a 20 min drive from my house. Will definitely have to come back for a sunrise sometime soon!
This week, I will be releasing a free eBook - The Sacred Mountains of Tibet. One of the images will be this favorite of mine, taken by the light of a 10-day moon in Yading National Park in Sichuan Province. The heart of Shangri-La. Please consider subscribing to our newsletter to be the first to know our news and updates - Many thanks.
Just this past week, I started posting Retina quality desktop, iPad and iPhone wallpapers of some of my images. Here is the link: And here are a few of the images-
