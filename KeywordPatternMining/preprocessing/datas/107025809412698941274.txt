Nice work Dave! I love this waterfall. One of the difficult one to photograph! First time I got there, I was amazed by the size of it. I had seen ton of picture beforehand, but I did not expect to see such a giant structure in front of me! Did you go down to the base of the waterfall? I know it is a bit of a scramble and with rain it gets even harder, but the falls seems even bigger when you are at the base of it.
I was there last week as well. I think on Wednesday afternoon, if I remember it correctly. The Panther creek was running very high. Although I did scramble down the slope, but I was really afraid of hurting myself and not able to hike up. I wouldn't have done that if I was there alone I had a friend who stayed on the platform, just in case! I am planning to make it to Proxy falls may be this week or early next week. Thanks.
