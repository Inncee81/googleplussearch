Got to love the NFC features. My Canon shouldn't feel too safe :P I guess the lenses for my Canon won't fit with this one though...?
So the lenses for my Canon will fit with this? Will definitely have + Sony in the back of my head next time I'm going to get a new camera
As my + Sony KDL-40x2000 is getting kind of old... and small. I was thinking about saving up for a + Sony 4K in a year or two. If the HMZ-T3W is as good as it seems I may have to reconsider though. Can't imagine using this for games! Will definitely keep an eye on these in the coming months
Canon 600D, Canon EF 70-200mm f/4.0L and Sigma 50mm F1.4 EX DG HSM for the most part. It's too much to carry in certain situations though, so I'm considering the QX100
Will the handles of this fit my Z Ultra? And why the limitations compared to the RX100? No 1080p video recording is kind of a dealbreaker to me... or can this be improved by a later software update?
Thanks for reply + Sony Strange that you don't make it fit your own phones I must say, especially for the Z Ultra which took a step back on the camera front, making the QX even more relevant. I'm not sure what you mean by smartphones only accommodate mp4 files and can therefor not do 1080p though. Doesn't smartphones already record in 1080p? The new Samsung phones even record in 4K resolution. I'm sure you have your reasons, but I think you can see where I'm coming from. The RX100 can do it and the QX100 is basically the same camera without the viewfinder (or so I thought), but with no 1080p, no RAW, more limited manual controls etc. I guess I'll be sitting on the fence a little longer before deciding whether to get the QX100 or not. Hopefully much of it is just software updates
Just hope the next generation of it will fit my Z Ultra!
How about integrating Google Music into the walkman app? I mostly use Google Music so I can't take advantage of the features of the walkman app except for the few songs I have on my phone.
Sounds good enough through Google Music though. I tend to leave those enhancements off anyway. Just sometimes it's nice with them one but usually they just fatigues my ears in the long run.
Got those headphones about half a year ago and I'm very happy with them Wish they were a little bit more portable though, but usually I have them on my head anyway, so no big deal :P

Is the sides metal/aluminium, or plastic?
