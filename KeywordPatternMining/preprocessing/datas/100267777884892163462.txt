The lens size will always be an issue IMHO.. I use M4/3 ( and 4/3 before that) because I NEED to travel light.. The camera , lenses, batteries, filters etc. all come with me in my laptop bag WITH the laptop...
+ Marcus Schommler You miss the point slightly.. You will ALWAYS be able to get smaller lenses for MFT than for full frame.. Of course you can get giant/heavy/crazy lenses for MFT, if the only difference is the mount... In my case I simply wouldn't invest in a big/heavy lens for my EM-5. ping in this for + Mario van Antwerpen too
Yes + Gordon Laing - I wonder the same thing as + Allen Corlett ? ;) Looks like good kit!
