OMG NON REMOVABLE BATTERY ... HOLY SHIT WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE. I have a charger at home..in the car and at the office... ï»¿also have a USB battery backup pack ... I don't need a removable battery ever.
Manufacturer bullshit? My last phone had a removable battery and I was never replaced and I had chargers in the same place. + Jayfo Nitrof you mad bro? I work on the road doing deliveries.. There no excuse to not have a charger nearby.
+ Jayfo Nitrof you're the only troll here mister my life can't exist without a swappable battery lmao. There's no excuse.
