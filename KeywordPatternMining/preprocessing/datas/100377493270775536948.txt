Cool review + Gordon Laing . I'm excited to see full frame compact system cameras finally hitting the market. You and I have talked about our joy of the OM-D E-M5 so I think I'll wait to see more results from your test with this and to see what Panasonic and Olympus come out with to compete. But if these offerings can match up to what I get from my Nikon, then a jump to something smaller and lighter is in the books for me. I'm looking forward to seeing your updates.
