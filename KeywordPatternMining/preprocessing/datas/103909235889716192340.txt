But how is this possible? No media involved are they just going to wake up on 15 and say here's 4.4 & the nexus 4s? Doesnt add up.
Yeah doesn't make since and apple has the iPad announcement around that time also.
But this would be a first for Google to not having media there to cover it. And this is Google's flagship device and newest os. Foolish to not invite the media.
