+ Stefan Lubinski you might want to read this before you proclaim "facts" disprove McCarthy's allegation:
+ Gabriel Maria Platt that Wikipedia article supports the notion that McCarthy was a giant asshole. Nobody's disputing that. What was at hand was whether or not his primary allegation, that there were Soviet spies infiltrating the US, was correct. It provably was correct. You can't dispute that by providing evidence he was a colossal jerk; nobody's disputing that he was a jerk.
You mentioned him in response to someone, and you implied that someone was incorrect in your mention. If your mention was a complete random non-sequiter and you flagged people as if you were responding to them by accident, well, I can't help you with that.
