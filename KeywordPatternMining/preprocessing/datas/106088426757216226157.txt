The structure has character so I see what inspired you to get this image...Love the tone, looks like a scanned print. But it feels cluttered to me. Maybe getting rid of the mailbox stand in the foreground would help, smaller building lower left... not sure. Being a bit picky I guess, but it's not getting me there. #delete2
