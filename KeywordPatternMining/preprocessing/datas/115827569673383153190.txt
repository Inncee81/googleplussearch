Yep, $75k for what people are going to call a Volt Coupe? I doubt many will sell.
That is a bit pricey... it better be REAL NICE for that kind of money.
Regular cars in EV spots can be towed by the owner of the business, should they choose to do so. The police would only get involved if it were public parking. A few weeks before I had my Volt, I swung into a parking lot at a public park in South Austin. There were three or four EV parking spots, marked as such, with regular vehicles parked there. Granted the lot was completely full, but being a public park, those vehicles could have been ticketed. As for running into people parked in EV spots at a place like Ikea, you can complain to the management (and probably should) because people that do that, while not breaking any laws, are going against the wishes of the property owner. As for an EV owner unplugging another EV to plug theirs in, paid charger or not, I'm generally going to consider that a dick move... UNLESS it's a dire situation, OR the first plugged in car is indicating fully charged. If I got to a public charger and plugged in, I'd be peaved at the discourtesy of being unplugged before full charge, but if my car were fully charged, I wouldn't mind much at all. I guess it really comes down to etiquette, and I don't think there is any established yet. If I came across a plugged in car and knew it was fully charged, I wouldn't feel bad about taking the plug, but I'd probably leave a note "hey, I saw your car was charged, so I grabbed the plug", but I'd want to be sure it was done charging.
