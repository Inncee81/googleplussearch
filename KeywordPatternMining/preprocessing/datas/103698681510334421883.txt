Sounds neat. I'd still prefer Flickr though - 1 TB is more than enough, and it doesn't feel quite so vendor specific (plus allows for third party applications).
Sure. And with Flickr too. Does this service support videos?
I really haven't noticed much difference, but I'm mainly running my MBP docked in a single monitor setup with a single Thunderbolt Display right now, so I'm not getting to enjoy the multimonitor improvements or the battery life improvements. So I've barely noticed that I'm running Mavericks. I like the new Safari, though. I did get an itch to get a maxed out 27" iMac instead, though, for a dual 27" setup with even better performance, since I'm so rarely undocking my laptop nowadays... My colleague got his BTO yesterday. Seems like a really sweet machine.
That would be nice. I'm using my Logitech Ultrathin keyboard cover all the time with my iPad 3. I could see myself getting an iPad 5 with an original keyboard cover!
