never had the original n7 but i did however have the asus tf300 which had the tegra 3 and have many if not the same complaints... i have to blame the tegra 3... now an owner of the nexus 4 and 7 (2013) and love them both... if you liked your n7 when you got it you would most likely enjoy the newer one for a fat greater time + Mark Lastiwka
not everybody wants to root their device and peruse the internet for roms and kernels... go back under the bridge troll
ugh do everyone who knows you a favor and kill yourself... you're a repugnant loser
everybody listen up! + Ryan Martins believes every android phone must be voided by root regardless of the owner's choice so starting October 10th, 2013 every owner of any android device must scour the internet for methods to root and rom your phone... not owning a computer is no excuse neither is lack of experience... dipshit
