Hi Sony Xperia! Could you please tell me how do you think about the Xperia Z's camera? You know what, it makes my tear drops down, as my friends asked me, why do I always keep using the phone with the same brand (Sony)? I answered, because I love this company that they always produce very good quality of camera and best quality of music payer, and I love almost everything on the XZ but when I went out with my friends in the night time and I wanted to show off to my friends with my brand new Sony Xperia Z with 13 megapixel camera, but unfortunately, one of my friend has the Samsung Galaxy S3 with just 8 Megapixel camera that she can take a much more beautiful, sharp, crisp and clear photo than the 13 megapixel camera on my Xperia Z. To be honest, it is a very bad quality camera I've ever seen on Sony, shall I switch to Samsung or other brands with all of my other friends or what should I do to make my XZ can make much more beautiful pictures than the 8 megapixel of the S3? I'm a Sony fan, I don't know what to say to my friends anymore, but I will wait until the next update is coming and will try it out again, to see if it helps me, otherwise, no more "Sony" and I'll sell it out and go the S3 for the better camera quality. I'm sorry, I don't want to say like this, but it hurts me too much.
One more thing I found, the camera and the LED flash are too close to each other, so when I took a picture at night with the LED flash on, I saw the white shiny bright light from the right side flashed into the picture. I am not just only complaining without any reason or don't understand about the technology, I tried everything, I tried without the flash, with the flash, superior auto, normal mode, HDR, 12 megapixel, 13 megapixel and even installed new apps. Still not better.
