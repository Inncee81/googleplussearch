Cough 3 cough no additional charge cough sorry you keep posting irrelevent companies. You must be able to tell 3 is the only way to go. Why do you bother?
Thank you 3 fans, + gordon christie sorry buddy your right back when they were just doing phones that gave video calls i could understand your point but they are buying more and more masts all the time. I currently get signal around the hospital that o2 took down a mast because they could not justify keeping. so all the o2 customers have no signal and 3 does. I realise this is perhaps a 1 off but just a little proof in my puddin
Must resist jokes. Ah well thats too bad but to another end it is androuid uk and scotland want to be independant so we van stop paying for your education so win win. Sorry to tempting
Same here looking at that price plan your looking at £45 for what you would get on the one plan oh but there is no cap. And the one plan is give or take £10 cheaper. Yay 3
