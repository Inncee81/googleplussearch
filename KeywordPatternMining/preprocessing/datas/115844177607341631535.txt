+ Nick Felker it means within your voice setting its set to use voice all the time as the default, not that anything is integrated as of yet.. Settings>General>Making calls (4 options, yours being the 1st)
+ Nick Felker Actually, I'm an idiot.. thats for calls. The text settings are under Synchronization and notifications.. under Notifications, which only has 2 settings: GV app or Messaging app. Sorry for the initial mix up.
With all the problems I've read about iMessage, I'm not mad at that at all. If that is in fact the case when it's released.
