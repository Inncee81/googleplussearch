Plus this beauty is, I believe, the first full frame mirrorless body that almost any legacy lens in any mount produced in the last century can be used at the original focal length - no crop factor at all. The digital Leica's can be seen as an exception though as being full frame rangefinder cameras. Shooting without a crop factor is really a BIG thing for me especially for wide angle lenses. These cameras are not Leica killers I think, as some suggest in their comments, but the A7R can well be a better camera in terms of IQ (not as a source of status) than a digital Leica just because of its sensor. I wish I could afford the A7R today!
+ Spyros Papaspyropoulos I will still be a NEX kid until I can afford the Alpha 7R as well. Btw these two new bodies might also be considered as a collector's item as they are the first ever Alpha bodies that do not carry the A-mount introduced by Minolta around two decades ago. ;-)
That's f### awesome (incl. the portrait shot!)
