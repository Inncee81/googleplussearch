Everywhere I go they are sold out on preorders...﻿at least offline.
Still I think over a million preorders since e3 is pretty damn good.
Yea I hear ya. Didn't slot of those people have to wait a long time to recieve their preoders? Also. Anyone find a confirmed launch title list?
Lol he said over a million not exactly a million + Jason Long actually I think ffxiv passed over a million beta testers lol
After seeing him switch to the vita dead in Tue middle of ac4 that almost sold me. Plus if ac4 is as long as ac3 it might be a good investment. Though watchdogs is like a gamestyle I have never seen. Kz will probably just be awesome all around lol
So what game would you guys choose between those three?
Bf4 isn't really my selection. I already have to buy cod ghosts for ps4 when my friend gets it. I'll get bf4 later. So then I suppose that means watchdogs out of kz and ac4 you would pick + Jason Long
+ Jason Long Jason your the second person to tell me that. Sigh still not sure lol. I did really enjoy all of the kz games and I here this one is more open world. Decisions decisions lol.
+ Travis Blair Travis I will probably get knack at some point too. It does look like a lot of fun.
+ Richard Dixon yea I plan on knack for sure. Looks really cool. I think I have decided on canceling my beyond two souls preorder and getting kz and watchdogs. Just something about both that I really like.
I heard from a podcast the game development for the Xbox one will not be available to consumers. Only indie devs. Basically allowing them to self publish their titles. It was the PS nation podcast.﻿ sorry that's a little off topic. As far as the ouya goes it was an interesting concept. I can't believe they cannot deliver what they promised the consumer. I'm glad I steered clear of this.
