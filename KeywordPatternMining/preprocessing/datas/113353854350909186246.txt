+ Cali Lewis you are going to be there?
+ Daria Musk yeah the girls would love + Cali Lewis for sure and she is could by great Idol for those girls
+ Benjamin Roethig heh I suggested that earlier so should I be credited from that to put Cali and Daria on the same hangout?

+ Cali Lewis if you found out faster way to travel from huge distances then i could
ok FOWA is closer than dallas
