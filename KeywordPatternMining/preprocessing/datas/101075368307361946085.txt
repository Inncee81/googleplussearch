yes and yes, its all photography, but try shooting a wedding on an iphone...
Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean its a good idea ;p
+ Lexy Savvides I'd like to see the shots from the reception... All those are outside or in good light, so a credit to getting the best out of what they had to work with but if my wedding shots looked like that I'd be unsatisfied, probably because I know what's possible, and what is possible requires things the iphone isn't. As + Stephan Bollinger said, there is a time and places that you just need certain gear that wouldn't be classed as "mobile" photography. I'd still consider a wedding one of those places.
