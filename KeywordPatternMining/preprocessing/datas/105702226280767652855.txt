I still use Vimeo as my primary channel. Honestly, I hardly use YouTube, only for short shots or stuff "for fun". I think my primary reason is because I'm used to it. The iOS Vimeo app is great
Good point there Davide! Food for thoughts.... thanks!
It costs $10,900 and production just started. Good thing is all DSLR stuff works on it, so if you have Nauticam (or Zen) ports, domes, rings, ... you can use them. But still, though a Nauticam fan, not convinced....
