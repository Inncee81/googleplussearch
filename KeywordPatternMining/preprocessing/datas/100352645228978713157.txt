I like the launchers that add something useful rather than just changing the look. I would definitely give this a try. For those that don't have access to it, you may want to look at Everything Home. It has some similar functionality. It has smart folders to automatically sort apps and lets you create your own too. It doesn't change dynamically based on location or time but it does have some other unique abilities
