13th in race one. John was victim to some early race contact and a spin on oil at the final corner. Didn't have the pace of those around us at the end. Pretty average ol' day. #flyingkiwi
Had better days. Leaking tyre and a crimped pair of bollocks in qualifying. #infertile

Rest in Peace #SeanEdwards . I had the pleasure to grid up with him at Monza in 2010 and witness his skills first hand. An undeniable talent that has demolished the competition in the Porsche Supercup this season...can't believe it
I am not moving from this spot today. #Bathurst1000
Off to the #Sony Open House in the City. New gadget time! #nerd
Grab this month's issue of #NZfullthrottle for a feature on the #SLSAMGGT3 I race in Asia, as well as a personal feature story. #flyingkiwi
Here are some highlights from the early phase of yesterday's #SIERDC race at Ruapuna #flyingkiwi
Into Porsche mode this weekend! Really looking forward to joining Fastway Racing at Ruapuna! #flyingkiwi
The #JMR47 crew worked their butts off to no avail this weekend. We didn't make the start of the race with an engine problem. #flyingkiwi
Race still going, we're not in it. Broken muffler on Lap 2 and now a misfire. The colony of Gremlins have set up a cosy camp at JMR.
A chance to fight back today with two 56 lap races in the #JMR47 #V8ST . #flyingkiwi
We were on track for a pretty reasonable finish in race one before a clutch failure just a couple of laps into my stint. #badluck #flyingkiwi
Better Qualifying than expected. Snuck into the 10 which after this morning is a big improvement! John's turn now! #teamwork
Working on some balance issues in the #47. See how we stack up in the next one, only 45 mins to #SOSO (sort our shit out) ;)
All set for tomorrow. Two practices, two qualifyings and the first 36 lap race. #flyingkiwi
Heading out to the circuit now for a big weekend of V8 racing. Let's go! #flyingkiwi
Can't wait to crack into a big weekend of V8 racing with #JMR47 ! Aucklanders get on out to Hampton Downs, gonna be #grouse . #flyingkiwi
+ nzherald.co.nz #Driven weekend motorsport wrap from my race in Suzuka as well as Fastway Racing's winning season opener at Mitch Evans in GP2 at Singapore
Tried out the #Morfit system at Suzuka and was super impressed! Kiwi designed and made for back support while driving. Take a look at www.morfit.co.nz
This weekend I go from an AMG V8 to a Ford V8, with John McIntyre Racing in the V8SuperTourers. Let's do it! #flyingkiwi
Nice gallery of shots from the #Suzuka weekend here... https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151514917395778.1073741831.186173335777&type=3 #flyingkiwi #PICS
Double victory! The boys have kept the championship alive with some brilliant driving today. BRING ON AUTOPOLIS!
Role reversal! Race win for Car 28 and Car 1 in 4th. Awesome work TK! #Suzuka
A snapshot of yesterday's race. The top 4 were never more than this far apart, even in traffic! Two races today for my team mates to make a big push before the Championship final at Autopolis! #flyingkiwi
My Soundcloud race notes. Thanks for the support once again this weekend, we have some ground to cover in tomorrow's two races. Keep pushing! #flyingkiwi
4th in a crazy race. Cars in front blatantly punting slow traffic and passing under yellows, but not penalised. Not good enough.
Look at that split! 3rd in my qualifying segment by 7/100ths of a second. We have taken the crucial overall pole point, our first since Korea! #flyingkiwi #Suzuka
Qualifying begins soon, and I'll complete the first Sprint Race this afternoon. Here's 'the road ahead', shot with the Sony New Zealand #ActionCam yesterday. #flyingkiwi #suzuka
After a shaky start to the day we've finished up in P2. We haven't been this competitive on raw pace since Korea and the 28 car feels amazing. Bring on tomorrow! #flyingkiwi #Suzuka #SLSAMGGT3
Thankfully we will be out for Practice Three here at #Suzuka ! In the meantime, I've been following practice for the South Island Endurance Series opener at Invercargill. The boys at Fastway Racing with John McIntyre Racing and Simon Ellingham Racing (pictured) topped practice in the new #9 machine!
Eric Thompson writes for + nzherald.co.nz #Driven about our pre- 2KCUP training day. I'll be keeping an eye on him at Hampton Downs next weekend!
This weekend we hit up #Suzuka ! Grouse track, and the home of my first SLS win in 2012. Just two rounds to go, every race is critical now #championshipcharge #flyingkiwi
Parked up for the #Sandown500 today cheering on Johnny Mac in the #18 Falcon. We hit V8-mode in the #V8ST in a fortnight! #flyingkiwi
#VIDEO : Ride on board around Hampton Downs today in the new Fastway Racing #Porsche . #flyingkiwi
"Kickin' ass and takin' names"...brother in the E30 left his fuel cap off and gave the circuit a nice coating of unleaded! Good day so far, the new Fastway Racing machine is #grouse ! #flyingkiwi
