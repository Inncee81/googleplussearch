+ Dan Pawlak Thanks Dan! And I believe I would choose a Donald Trump or a Ted Cruz pinana so that I can take out my frustrations by beating on their likenesses. Reasonable? Maybe not. Fun? Hell yes!
+ Kelly N. Get out of here! What are the odds that me and your GF would have the same birthday? I know the answer! Just a smidge off of 1 out 365. But that's very cool. Hopefully this means you like the Libra qualities. Thanks for the well wishes. I appreciate it! And Happy Birthday to your GF!
Thanks + Piera Coppola ! I refuse to believe the age that my birth certificate indicates, so I hope there's truth to the adage, "You're only as old as you feel." Holla!
I actually love the project management-based brain that thought of this!
