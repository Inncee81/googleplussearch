If you would pay $200 for a watch, why not pay for one that has Android inside. Unlike #samsunggear , this device plays well with others (smartphones that is). Along those lines, why is #Samsung so hell bent on being so similar to Apple? Where you have to use their accessories with their products and no one else's?
