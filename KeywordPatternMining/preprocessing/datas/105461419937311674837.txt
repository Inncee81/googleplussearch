What do you mean by 'GH3 killer!'. M43 vs full frame. Are you suggesting the GH3 would be a better camera with a full frame sensor? It would just have the advantages and disadvantages of full frame. M43 for its correspondingly smaller lenses is for some a huge advantage.
Reasons not to. Small battery poor video Ugly over styled No built in flash Reasons to Pdaf better c-af (but not in video mode) Better evf? Perhaps, prefered gh3 to em5 5 axis great but I found IBIS 12-35 and 35-100 very good as well GH3 has more appeal for me.
I use my gh3 with the evf set to info below the image. I much prefer this mode shooting 3:2 as less distraction. I dont see how my images would be improved by a better evf. The gh3 evf does the job well. I'm not saying vf4 is not better but cant imagine losing all the other gh3 advantages for it.
