Where did you find an image of the E-M1 from above? - I've only seen angle shots. I'm interested to see that angle if it is clear enough to let you match the hotshoes to scale the two bodies.
Thanks, found it now Although 43rumours has some interesting info, I try not to visit the site too often - the ratio of trolls:humans is too high.
It does? Maybe a 10mm prime would be useful but is the need 'desperate'?
