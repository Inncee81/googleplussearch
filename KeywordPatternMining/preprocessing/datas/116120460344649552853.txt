What underlying social contract? The only social contract that's legally binding is the Constitution. Warren is pulling a principle out of thin air and using it to justify her tax-and-spend policies. We should also remind her that the factory owner paid taxes to build the roads and educate the workers. He or she also employed people, who in turn paid taxes to build roads etc. Warren's "social contract" is just an ad hoc justification to grab more tax money.
The message here is understandable, but the logic is a mess. Everyone is flawed, but that doesn't mean that we can't make judgments. If my neighbor decides to sacrifice kittens to his dark god, I'm going to condemn that behavior. Whether or not I'm hypocrite is irrelevant; killing innocent kittens is just wrong. Moreover, tolerance is a virtue, but it's a secondary virtue subordinate to higher virtues. People who attack Christians for being judgmental are themselves making a judgment, one that they think it's reasonable to make. There's nothing wrong with them making this judgment, but they should realize that the other guy also thinks his judgments are reasonable to make. The real issue, then, is not whether or not we should make judgments; as moral agents, we can't avoid doing so. The issue is that we disagree over what should and should not be tolerated. I tolerate X, but you don't. I don't tolerate Y, but you do. The debate we should have should focus on the reasons for tolerating/not tolerating X and Y.
Taco chips on the side? The proper side with biscuit dogs is tater tots and/or baked beans.
