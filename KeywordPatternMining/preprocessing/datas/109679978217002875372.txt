Whats the charging rate on that cable ? 1.5amps ?
Does it charge at the same rate as the USB port or is there a limit on the interface on the Z1.
Using the official charger or a 2amp one...
Taken with the + Sony Xperia Z1 just now in Spain.
+ LG Electronics LG G2 is a great handset - but trying to be another Samsung, means we dont see the real LG
Is the Nexus 5 DOA ? Putting the software updates to one side, what we have seen in the LG G2 doesn't give us much excitement over the N5. The price will be higher than the N4 was purely based on spec alone, and would the additional cost make it worth it then the LG G2 will be higher spec'd at only a smaller investment again ? Waiting for the next Nexus vendor to arrive (either Sony, Motorola or even HTC) would be our tip as this is LGs last effort.

The Sony gets closer to the actual colours, the LG 'yellow' is a little off.
Anything you want me to test ?
I'm not sure I agree 100% but see where you are coming from. They have taken aim at Samsung for sure. However its much closer to the Nexus range in many ways. Turning off all the silly features there really is a top notch phone under it all. We will update more as we spend time with it.

Our second part in a series of long term testing, this time the + LG Electronics G2 flagship handset, does it have the ability to knock off the S4 from its perch - or is it a cheap knock off ?? We take a look at the UI and Camera - early impressions + other stuff ! #lgg2 #lg

+ Sony Xperia Z1 test comes to an early end, camera issues and some daft design problems stop a great phone from being just that. We hope that Sony comes back with a better effort in the Z2 and learns from the mistakes of this handset, dont get us wrong we love the Z1, just misses the mark on its USP. #sonyxperiaz1 #sony
Its a great handset, in hindsight we gave it a ruff ride because expectation was so high. When we did a quick side by side with the LG G2 we were expecting the LG it beat it, but it only came close in a few areas. However screen times were the same and the STAMINA mode does help with the Sony. The Z1 has zero lag. Its a fast handset. There are a few short comings and the 20mp only being available in manual camera mode is criminal.
+ Roland Hamid Yeah. The Z1 will beat the N5 for style all day long though. You can use the 20mp setting all the time and the pictures look great. Look on our other posts. The LG G2 pics are good but that's only 10mp when in full frame mode. Something the N5 will suffer with too as they pixels don't fill a frame at 13mp and above. I'd love the N5 but think I'll wait until LG are no longer making Nexus.
So take the Sony.
Just make sure it has a case on it, its slippy like the N4.
More from our long term road test, the slippy handset has started to show its weaknesses now. + Sony Xperia #sony #sonyxperiaz1
We agree, some of the camera features are dumb, like the 20px only works in manual mode. + Sony Xperia have said there is a way round it but it doesnt work on our unit.

Another day passes with the + Sony Xperia Z1 on + T-Mobile UK from + Phones 4u We take a look at its real world abilities after the unit has been charged a few times. The screen and battery all get a good testing. #sonyxperiaz1 #sonyxperia #sony #smartphone
+ David Hill We have one and it still took drain from the battery. We tried the 5v 1.5amp and the incar fast charge.

We have at long last got out + Sony Xperia Z1 up and running, time to give it the once over - we are happy to answer any questions on the handset and test whatever you want us to. IHAG will update in progress of the phone over the next month, rather than give it a test and throw it back into its box. Once done the + LG Electronics G2 should be with us, then the + Omate TrueSmart Smartwatch should arrive from the US. Stay tunned ! #sonyxperiaz1 #lgg2
Incoming to IHAG soon, + LG UK G2, + Sony Xperia Z1 and Smartwatch 2. We also have by the end of November the + Omate TrueSmart Smartwatch, and #Pressy Please share and make sure you stay with us for proper real world reviews. Not crazy ass lab tests !! + GSM Arena

We prefer the + Omate TrueSmart - get the SW2 with the Z1, and then re-fill your credit card for the cost of the Omate ;)
Then don't worry about the SM2, get the + Omate TrueSmart instead.
+ Mark Taylor the price is the same so that's not a problem. However waterproof to IP67 and Google play means more functions. Plus I think the Sony watch doesn't look as good as the Omate.
I know alot of OUYA gamers like some Retro fun, how about this ?!
