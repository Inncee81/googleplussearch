Been coaching my wife with her Tmo variant. It's butter smooth and lightning fast. Awaiting my Big Red Note 3 hopefully coming Friday.
Btw, I can tell you right now, the feature I will use the most will be Action Memo, specifically the call straight from your handwritten note trick. ï»¿Bet I use it 3-4 times per day with my job.
Pre-ordered my wife's Note 3 a couple of weeks ago. This may sound dumb, but I guess I goto a T-Mobile store to pick it up? They really didn't tell me anything. My Verizon Note 3 is hopefully coming next week.
