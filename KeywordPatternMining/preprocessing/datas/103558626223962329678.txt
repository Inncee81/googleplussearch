+ Jesse Ivery Where did you get your information? Depending on which model you buy (C6903 or C6906) LTE is available on any carrier. I have the C6903 and LTE is good on TMOBILE. Get the C6906 and you are good with ATT and Verizon. Google it and you can verify what I have said.
I know Verizon will not be getting this. The Z1, if you look at the SPECS is GSM/CDMA compatible. Depending on the model is capable of freqs as low as 700 (ATT and Verizon LTE) and as high as 1900 (TMOBILE 1700 LTE). Research this information before you try to correct someone. I am talking about unlocked versions. Why do people like being locked in stupid contracts for a phone anyway?
Google is a great and wonderful thing for those of you asking about the release and other details on this phone. I am in the US and somehow I have the Z1. I wonder how that is...
+ Rene Fernandez No I am not confused. I have the Z1. I have the unlocked version. Other people have the Z1. It is possible to purchase. I was impatient and purchased mine from the UK and works on ATT network just fine. I stand corrected. My research was wrong in thinking some of the cell phone stores were US selling in the US. They are selling in the US and located outside of the US.
+ Kris Stone it is in the US and has been since 9/24
Good things come to those who wait. And if you are waiting for a carrier to sell you a phone then you are just being ripped off anyway.
