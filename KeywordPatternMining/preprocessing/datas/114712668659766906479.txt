I love this show + Cali Lewis !!! If you don't enjoy it then I will make fun of you until your 80 years old I will still admire you.
+ Cali Lewis is pretty late to the party + John Pozadzides .. I dont want to tell on her, but I could have sworn I saw her in a store buying some MC Hammer pants and a lime green tubetop. It was so embarrassing that I hid my face like I didnt know her as I walked by. Then I heard her in the background making a loud fuss with the cashier because they didnt accept Discover card or something.
I can use the wand as a shoe horn and to itch those hard to reach places. A light sabor would kill me in each scenario.
hahaha + John Pozadzides Not the same ring to it!
+ John Pozadzides I remember one time I hit a speed bump with my Mustang really hard and afterwards went straight to McDonalds.. and of course by speed bump I really mean an old man and by McDonalds I mean Prison.
