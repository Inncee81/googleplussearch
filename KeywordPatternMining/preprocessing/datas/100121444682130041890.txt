Bummer. I liked the idea of Moto X. I'll always take efficiency over brute force, and the X felt just as smooth as any other premier handset I've used this year. Just like any other phone manufacturer, it seems more conservative expectations will be in order. It'll probably be a couple years before Moto is profitable again. I wonder if Google will hold on to them long enough to see that happen, or if they'll chop them up and sell off parts of the company before then...
