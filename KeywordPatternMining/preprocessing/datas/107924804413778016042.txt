Well, I guess the love for the OM-D line and the newer E-M1 in particular was short-lived and fun while it lasted....
Love it! Just got my E-M1 body on Monday afternoon, just waiting for the 12-40 to make it's way in. Can't wait!
According to my local camera store it is showing a ship date earlier to the brick and mortar stores. I guess latest update is 10/17
I am actually surprised I got the E-M1 already... apparently shipped also to brick and mortar before online retailers.
+ Artur Vizdoaga you know I actually like that they are servicing the smaller local shops first. I prefer to support them when I can...
