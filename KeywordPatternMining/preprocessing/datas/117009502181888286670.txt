+ Mike Ester No problem, just passing time before a meeting.
I just had two people see the sign today and gave it a whirl. Fortunately there was a security camera pointed at the printer and I was able to see the footage. I just about wet my pants I was laughing so hard. They tried for about 2 minutes to get it to work. They finally looked up and pointed at the camera like the old Candid Camera shows. Too funny!!!
