+ Gino Barasa , I certainly share your feelings about cloud based storage, the loss of control just doesn't sit well with me. Adobe's new subscription blueprint was also initially off putting, but the $10 monthly fee for the software I use the most seems a little more enticing. I don't necessarily share your "the sky is falling" assessment though. Drobo and WD are still cranking out consumer grade hard drives and until the next great CS update, all known software that a pro such as yourself is likely to use, is still available for installation on the machine of your choice. Aren't we waiving the white flag a little prematurely?
Got the shipping notification on my Capture Pro yesterday, can't wait to try it out. This was my first experience with a Kickstarter campaign and the Peak Design people were great about continually sending out updates during every step of the process. Seems like a well run outfit.
