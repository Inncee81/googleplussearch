I try to remind myself of this often. Usually when I'm grousing about having to pay a school tax when I don't have any kids. The way I see it, as a country, we're far better off and stronger if we are in this together than each of us on our own. The common good is good for all.
Awwww. Now I'm sad! Couldn't Google have arranged it so that everything was perfect today and when I got home my new Nexus 5 would be waiting for me free of charge??? I mean, come on!!!
Hope there is much more to come + Artem Russakovskii including announcement or release date!
