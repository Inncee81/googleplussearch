How is working on a tablet with that freaking button on the face? That is the only thing that kept me from getting the 8" model.
+ Alexander Maxham I can take that Nexus 7 off your hands and promise to use it all day every day. I don't know what I'd do without mine. I have Galaxy Tab 8.9 and a Kindle Fire 8.9 that are constantly in use.
