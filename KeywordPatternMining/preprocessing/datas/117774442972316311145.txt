I hate government spending my tax dollars on wars overseas. Lots of tax dollars... I would rather help Americans than pay to destroy and rebuild another country. Not saying defund military ... Don't get your panties knotted up . just saying spend a little less on it, we would still be spending more than anyone else. Oh and + Douglas Boehme you stay classy.
I pay taxes and many others do as well. Lets get more of the people of the united states to pay more taxes. We could start by creating more jobs and increasing the minimum wage to a livable wage. Factory workers used to make a livable income and could provide for their whole family while the wife stayed home with the kids (not that women should be expected to anymore). Keeping jobs here in America instead of shipping them overseas. America was doing very well when Americans cared about Americans. There were taxes back then too and it wasn't socialism. Wealthy companies expanded and created new jobs in the past. Now everyone has this mentality to step on as many people as possible to stick millions and billions in a bank where it sits while america is going broke, and the middle class is diminishing.
Mail it to someone for the ultimate Rick Roll.. Its how people Rick rolled in the 80's
