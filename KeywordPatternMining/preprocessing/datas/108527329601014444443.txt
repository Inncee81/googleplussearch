You are correct. Hangouts do not send your own voice through your speakers. There will be an echo issue if someone else is streaming the hangout at the same time as the broadcast (I was not in this case). + Anthony Kelly - It's very quick. If you have playback review running, I have noticed it is not as quick since it needs to come up with a playback image in addition to sending the photo to your phone. However, if you do not have playback running, the photo goes instantly to your phone's photo library/camera roll etc... + Jordan Rawlings - It works on most iOS and Android devices. The app that it uses is the PlayMemories Mobile App available in the Google Play store and Apple App store. It's a free app.
Thanks + Dave Ortiz . The echo isn't the best but I appreciate it. I think it was an issue with another instance of the hangout running at the same time (remembering back to all the hangouts I have done and the issues people have had with evil echo). I agree that these devices will open up a world of possibilities for mobile photographers and camera users alike.
Hi + Roman Ruiz - Hangouts will never send your own voice through your speakers. Thanks for the feedback. I have done quite a few Hangouts on Air and usually this issue occurs when someone is streaming an additional instance of the hangout in addition to the broadcast. I hope people were able to hear some of the info. I have done some writing about the device as well on my photography blog and have been taking questions about the device(s) on my G+, Facebook and on my blog. Feel free to ask me anything you would like to know about the device.
+ Anthony Kelly - Thanks! I think that we will see a lot of interesting developments with these devices in the future (especially since the API has been released).
+ Patrick Ostertag - Thanks! I will definitely be posting QX100 photos interspersed with my regular photo posts. I am going away this weekend as well to cover a wine and food festival and I will be bringing the QX100 along for that, for sure.
