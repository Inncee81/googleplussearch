Yes, by installing sungsonic hd CUSTOM ROM, u can use multiwindow feature, but multiwindow is not officially present in any updates for our tab. The issue is wid our old aged GPU CHIP, thats y galaxy tab3 7inch doent have multiwindow due to same GPU IN IT AS OURS... TAB3 8INCH has multiwindow since it has a 8 core GPU MAALI400...
No, custom roms are not available there. Go search for CUSTOM ROMS FOR TAB2 7 on google
