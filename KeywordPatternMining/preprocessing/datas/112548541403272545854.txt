I think I might be picking up some of these as well. Thanks for the suggestions + Juan Gonzalez . It's just not worth investing in the Canon or Nikon versions when a third party will let you do the exact same thing for fractions of the cost
this is stupid amazing Juan
hey + Juan Gonzalez - why did you sell them for these? I have friends that shoot Nikon & are about to invest in some flashes.
now that is awesome!
