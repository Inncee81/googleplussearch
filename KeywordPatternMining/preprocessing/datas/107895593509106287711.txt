CyanogenMod Installer - Usability Testing Want to beta the CyanogenMod installer? We're looking for usability testers, and are also looking to validate the driver packages across a broader range of Windows installations and PCs. To participate in the beta, you must have the following: 1) a camera to record yourself doing the installation (we learn a lot watching nontechnical people use our stuff!) 2) a device we currently support [1] 3) willing to work with us on bug reports and feedback Right now, the process of installing an aftermarket Android operating system is too intimidating, and we believe this should be accessible to anyone. The real fun and power of Android starts with "fastboot oem unlock" [2], and we want that available to as many people as possible. If you're interested, let me know below, by telling me device you have and if you've ever run + CyanogenMod before. I'll be selectively adding people to the testers group. [1] Current devices: maguro, crespo, toro, toroplus, grouper, flo, mako, manta, skyrocket, hercules, i9100, i9300, d2att, d2spr, d2tmo, jfltexx, quincyatt, quincytmo, t0ltetmo, m7ul.
