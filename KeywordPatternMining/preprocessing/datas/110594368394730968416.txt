Easy answer... Yes and yes to both questions! Congrats on the new arrival
I recommend you this site + Michelle Silver , the best resource for Sony Minolta users:
I think you are a little confused. First of all there is no G mount but A mount! G is the letter that Minolta used to call its best glasses, like L for Canon or EX for Sigma. Clarified that and admitting the Sony lens in your list is a good copy I would go with it without any doubt. According with dixum it's certainly the best of the group. Sigma is not bad too but not as good as Sony would be. By the way, which version of the sigma are you considering, the last one on the market or a used copy? What kind of focus system, mechanic or ultrasonic? I would leave the tamron on the desk of the shop. Your a230 should have a built in focus motor so it should work with any kind of A mount lenses, including sigma and tamron you are considering.
Yes, + Aavo Raig is right! Best sites to look at for Sony users...
