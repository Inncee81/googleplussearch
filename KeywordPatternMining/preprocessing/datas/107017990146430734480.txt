I have both 7 and 10, I use the 10 everyday for work and personal. 7 is awesome also but I like the bigger form factor. You just need to do what you think is comfortable, to some it's the 7 others the 10. There are enough of each size that you could go to a best buy and play with some type of tablet and get a feeln for what you like. I also feel that with my galaxy nexus the 7 was a great tablet but not that much bigger than my phone. 10 is amazing
