Here is more from Reddit thread: LOL After watching the Nexus 7 ads, specifically the [best friend]( Google Nexus 7: Best Friend one, me and many others noticed this: The date on the tablet in the best friend video. Wednesday, October 23. I think this could be a hint to the real release date of the Nexus 5 and KitKat. Why is this date more likely to be the actual thing than any of the other rumors? It's before Halloween, so they have just the right amount of time to squeeze in some promotional stuff with the KitKat/candy/Halloween theme. It's a Wednesday. Every Google event this year has been a Wednesday (Google I/O, May 15th; 4.3 event, July 24th) 1 week ahead isn't too late to start sending out press invites Why else would they put that specific date on their Nexus 7 ads? Why announce Nexus 7 ads with a specific date on them, right on the day they know is rumored to be the announcement? It's also a day after the iPad event. They are then in a position to counter what Apple announces the day before. Disclaimer: pure speculation, will not eat dick if wrong.
+ Artem Russakovskii 31st is Thursday. Who does events on Thursday for a major product announcements? Sometime in last week is probable.
