+ Mark Lastiwka I know exactly what you mean. I can be casually using the Nexus 7 and suddenly everything grinds to a halt. Scrolling will also suddenly start to lag. The performance difference between my Nexus 7 (2012) and my old iPad 2 is just incredible. The iPad is always responsive, the Nexus 7...I never know what I'm going to get next. "Android is for learning and customization." is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to waste my time to figure out how to get a product to work as advertised. Like Mark said, we're not kids anymore, we don't have time to tinker to get a product to work as it should. We have work to do. If I'd been happy with my current Nexus 7 I would have considered one of the new ones. But as is, no way.
+ Mark Lastiwka Oh I just state my case and move on. That's the end of my engagement. Plus that is somewhat of a common theme that I see around here and not limited to that individual.
