I would like to appreciate HTC one which is one of the best android device of 2013... After that HTC company has gone mad by introducing ugly clowns of HTC one (mini &max). Even there pricing is horrible. Come on HTC you can do better than this and looking forward for another killer device.
It has got only 4gb of internal memory that means you get around 2gb user available memory..This is the biggest con. Let's analysis other con's after the review
+ Amit Bhawani hi.. Are you sure about the battery difference (16 & 32 GB)... Or just leaked specs
