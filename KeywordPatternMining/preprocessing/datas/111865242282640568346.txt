Time will tell, basically. I am not going to get upset until the truth rolls in. Google said a long time ago they are working on battery life through Project Roadrunner. I wouldn't be surprised to see the battery last all day assuming average use. ï»¿ I think it is far too early to worry about until we see what 4.4 has in store.
+ Alexander Maxham Oh well. I still think we need to just wait and see.
I don't know if we'll see a true 5.0 for quite a while. Google seems intent on improving the ICS structure and framework. They definitely hit the nail on the head as far as UI and style in my opinion.
