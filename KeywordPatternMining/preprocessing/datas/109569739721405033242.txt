I completely agree with how horrible the system is.. But if you have a registered card that is expiring you can transfer those funds to your new replacement card online... But it takes a week to transfer the funds. This process is the same as when a card is faulty.. I don't register the cards anymore as I heard of people calling and gaining access to the email/ login details from a lost card.. Also the login has all the cards you've ever registered with no ability to delete them..and no ability to delete the account... Well at least it was like that last time I checked.
I swore not to login to the site again , but if you enquire with a myki retailer or train station .. The form they give you for defects allows you to transfer but both cards need to be registered.
