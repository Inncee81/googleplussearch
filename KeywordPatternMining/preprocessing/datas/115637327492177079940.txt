Why? They must be 4k phones which is great, the top of the resolution mountain
+ Mike L + Jenel Berry they aren't they size of an iPad just more pixels. So basically putting all the pixels of an iPad and more in a 5.5 inch display. + Jazli Aziz I am a big fan of art design and fashion and mobile tech design, I'm constantly zooming in on a picture only to find a blur, I have seen a 4k tv and you can see the eye color of a person standing in the bleachers at a nfl football game. The displays are getting there and the batteries will follow.
+ Raihan Ramadistra noticed that but still the same argument
+ Tyler Strayhan thank you why are so many people afraid of the advances of technology
I just need to make calls and set sweet ringtones and use the calculator.......wait wait u people need iPhones!!!! Lol the point is people always complain about change then I see them a week later with the latest and greatest we had phones with the res of a calculator and battery life that would last for weeks, people said then that they were perfect.
