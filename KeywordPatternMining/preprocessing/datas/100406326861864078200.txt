First I can think of was Best of Jackson 5. For my Sony CD Walkman, no less.
Again, it'd be awesome if + Sony had thought a little more beyond the lens as a smartphone attachment, as innovative as it is, where this could be used with their gaming systems (Vita, PS3/PS4), Vaio computers, and Bravia TVs. Heck, even their Smartwatch. Unless they already do, and it just hasn't been mentioned... If not, maybe a firmware update or just the time it takes to produce the next iteration of these will allow it.
Excellent products, + Sony . Now please, advertise them proudly! (I meant to type "properly" but auto correct felt that was a better word choice. I agree.) People should see how a #onesony home could look.
Can't wait to say, "Welcome to America, Z1..."
I'll be happy when I can actually BUY this in Hollywood...

Between my gf and I (my influence, lol), we have two Sony flatscreens (Sony stereo hooked up to the larger), two Vaio laptops (my latest to replace one stolen from work), a PS3 (had a PSP before it was stolen at another job), my new Z, a SRS-BTV5, and my SBH52 is due in the mail this week. I'm waiting til the next iteration of Sony's smartwatch, tho. Hoping for a little more from it; Camera, mic, connectivity to/control of other Sony products (PS, Vaio, Bravia, Xperia, Walkman, etc), because they have the best ecosystem for it. Absolutely lovin Sony right now. Here's hoping the get back to their dominant position.
