Looks good + Gordon Laing , the thing that may be overlooked is the combo on the left is at least 2x the price! I think that is a huge m43 advantage. I think I saw the new sony 70-200 2.8 for something like $2900 or so? Compared to the 35-100 2.8 (I know, I know double the fstop, blah blah) for about $1200? Also looks a bit weird. Like the y slapped on a viewfinder and grip to the RX10.
Hey + Gordon Laing who are the cameras aimed at? Does sony specifically say?
