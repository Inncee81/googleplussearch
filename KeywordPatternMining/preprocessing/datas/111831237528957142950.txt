Nope.. after getting my hands on nexus4.. nothing beats the pure google experience..
+ Gavin Bradley well as i found from many reviews the nexus4 is snappy and very well capable.. and since it was only released last year google will be updating it for the next two years afaik.. so waiting for the nexus5 isnt really a big deal lol.. and coming from galaxy s3 the custom roms feel more stable than any other android.. i have the same paranoid version on both yet the s3 ever since it came out there wasnt a finished build available but only nightlies..
