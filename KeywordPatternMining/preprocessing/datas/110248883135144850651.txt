Nice shot! I also upgraded from a D200 to an D800E, not too long ago. Especially the low light performance is absolutely outstanding, compared to the D200. On the 200, the grainyness started to show at ISO 800, while the 800 is smooth into 3200. That has resulted in that I'm becoming too lazy bringing my tripod along.
