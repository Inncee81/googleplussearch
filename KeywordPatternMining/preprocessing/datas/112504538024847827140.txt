Mike Lawrie took over the company I worked for and drove it into the ground. The only thing he knows how to do is cut costs and put a nice coat of lipstick on it...he will chop every possible cash-saving part off the company and destroy the initiative and innovation capability of the employees by disempowering them. The man is a narcissistic pathological liar with a giant ego and nothing on his mind beyond lining his own pockets. That's a corporate raider, not a turnaround specialist. Pick Mulally, Microsoft shareholders.
