My ps4 will be under the Xmas tree. No need to open early
+ Nelson Morales might as well open my Xbox. Just dance, dead rising, killer instinct...yup. Can't wait
Killer instinct and me go waaaay back. Had it on the snes. + Neric Quinones and I used to play. Just Dance is for my daughter and Dead Rising is a fun game
And that was by noon today.
iPhone 5c...you know what the "c" stands for...CASH...cuz we are taking all of your money! Lmao!!!
