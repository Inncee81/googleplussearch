#save Indeed green it is! There is little I dislike about this image. actually almost nothing at all other than its not mine! Great focus on those wings, tons of detail. Eyes are a teeny weeny bit soft but who cares. Gorgeous pic.
Great idea and I know how difficult it is to shoot animals. I spent a few years shooting at Houston SPCA some of the felines and dogs for their website for the adoptions and cats are like practicing panning sometimes. They are FAST. Although I know that you shot the best you could with the time you had, this one has too many small technical issues to allow it to go through in my opinion. So its a #delete5 from me.
#delete For me its just another flower picture shot from above. Nothing in it for me sorry.
