Thank you + Max Kotchouro I like it a lot! It makes the wing span more dramatic and adds to the Wow factor
I agree with + Nev Nels about the 16:9 crop to play along the lines of the wings. It would be interesting to see in the before and after
#save I like this even though the sky looks a little blown out.
