Yeah, unfortunately it's still made by LG, Which should be a big red flag.ï»¿ Also, I'm on the play store page right now and the Nexus 5 isn't listed there.
I'm glad that you've had a good experience with your Nexus 4, I've had friends tell me some horror stories though, and in the past have had some pretty bad experiences with LG. At least being a Nexus, you don't have to put up with LG's software. My experience seems to be the polar opposite to yours, I love Samsung's devices, am actually replying to this on my S3, and have had good luck with them since the flip phone days. I've had 5 different Samsung phones over the years, 2 Androids, and plan to buy another as my next phone unless someone like HTC comes out with something better. I do really like the HTC ONE.
I'm not too sure how I feel about this. In a way, I kinda put my name out there when I try something and really like it. But on the other hand, it's me putting me out there. I'm not big on Google putting me out there without my knowing.
+ Cobalt Sieg Ahh, I was under the impression it just put you out there for the world.
