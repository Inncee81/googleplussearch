mine has double suspension, even though I was thinking on a bike like that, but still I need the double suspension for jumping
yeah, well in my case I use to jump with the bike because I use to go offroad on irregular terrain, so having double suspension helps a lot, but yours is good for the road, and surely I'd love one like that for speed
