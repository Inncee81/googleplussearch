Yeah bought the tablet (been waiting till the first of May to get mine, thought would get it at the end of May, when the WiFi one was released (getting 4G one) and noticed recently that the 4G one was released, so now just waiting for the website i've bought mine from to get some from their supplier before i can get it). Hope by the time i actually get it it'll be worth the wait (almost 2 months). Already bought a white case for it (before the tablet was even rekeased) and getting a microsd card (because 16Gig onboard storage, just isn't enough).
liked the small P series laptop, till they got rid of it.
Sony's really trying hard to sell this.
