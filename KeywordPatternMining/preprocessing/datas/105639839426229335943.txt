+ Edward Mi Even if Play Services could somehow patch this feature into older versions of Android, it would be terribly foolhardy to deploy something like that to the many hundreds of builds of android that exist for each device and OEM and carrier.
+ Alan Eurich the problem as I see it is if you roll out a Hangouts that responds to SMS to pre-4.4 devices you suddenly have a lot of people angry because they are getting doubly notified for every SMS. Not good UX. I think Google can either make it a setting in the Hangouts app that's off by default on pre-4.4 devices, or it can leave it out entirely. Neither are all that attractive options.
