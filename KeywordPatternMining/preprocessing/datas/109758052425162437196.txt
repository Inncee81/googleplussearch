Give me anything Apple...I'd sell it in a heartbeat. Apple does make good tech but pricing and propritary designs tick me off. That's where the IBM PC fail'd; pay IBM prices and you can have one of your own. To bad for them when other companies decided they didn't like the cost from IBM. So, along came the IBM compatible computer, and the dinosaur done died.
