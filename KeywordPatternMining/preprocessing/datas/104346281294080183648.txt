Correct me if I am wrong but I think that Christian Horner has confirmed that there are only 3 names on the 2014 RBR list: Raikkonen, Ricciardo and Vergne. And Alonso's contract expires at the end of 2016 so that's nothing to shout about. ( ). Nevertheless, I don't think that Fernando would agree to be RBR no. 2 while no. 1 is indisputable.
