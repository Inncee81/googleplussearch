Playing the best Final Fantasy on the best console. Also practicing merging a photo taken with flash with one without. #FinalFantasy #WiiU #gaming

I have to wonder if the announcer is an ex of hers, or a possessive fan. #EarthBound #Miiverse #WiiU #Nintendo #gaming
This is probably the most fun I've ever had fishing in a video game. Most other fishing mini-games in RPGs involved a lot of waiting, whereas in Breath Of Fire II you're luring the fish over, getting it to bite when it's close by and reeling it in before your line breaks. #WiiU #Capcom #BreathOfFire #Nintendo
So when we rename the input channels on our TV's we also make them CH 3, 03, 3, or something along those lines. We gotta stick to what we know.
A little something I doodled up in response to seeing that amusing facial expression. #3DS #WiiU #ShinMegamiTensei #Miiverse
The PowerA game case for #Nintendo DS and #3DS . "16 Game Clear Case" it says on the packaging but it only fits 15 DS and 3DS cards, along with your system's SD Card. It looks pretty nice, but the one I got had a metal hinge fall out, and have to be glued back in. For 7 dollars though, its not bad so far.
I see. It's certainly more durable and stylish than the club Nintendo game case, although the tight fit is a little concerning

So the #MH3U #WiiU stream last week was asking about how they could promote Monster Hunter to new players, as they had gotten reports about the Monster Hunter games being too difficult to get into during all their western releases. I conducted a small experiment with my roommates - One of them a call of duty champ and the other a civ/simcity enthusiast. The CoD champ died against a giggi. No, not a gigginox, a giggi. It was specifically during the bit where they teach you how to mine iron. Her morale kinda ran out there, but she was willing to give it another chance later. The Civ player got to where the guild quests opened up, but ran out of steam when the first quest was to gather mushrooms. Civ player understood that there's a big barrier to entry, and the game mechanics feel especially rewarding once you've gotten a handle of them, so he tried not to just say "make it easier for new players to get into it". He appreciated that there was a G-rank player nearby to offer tips, and we seemed to agree that you need a player that knows how to get into the game to sort of "tutor" new hunters. CoD champ might come back to this game later. Currently, she didn't have any suggestions, as she was overwhelmed by the options that the touch-screen offered, with suddenly having two screens and 50 customisation options, so we're going to try giving her the Pro controller and moving all the info to the TV screen on this next try. So how does Capcom make this game more accessible to newer players? Perhaps a cheap western-focused spinoff game that MH Vets can enjoy, but is mainly designed to teach the player how to pick, choose, and use the weapon of their preference and lead them into Monster Hunter games proper. If sales numbers of such a title are a concern, well there are two options. Make it cheap enough that its sales numbers won't matter, or have it compensate for its single player "extended tutorial" focus, by giving it a deeper, more engaging story than the average Monster Hunter game. An idea that just occurs to me is to make a game that leads into MH3U / MH4 via save-data transfer, it could be about a hunter training facility from which your hunter can carry over his supply box items and maybe a special set of equipment that you can only get in that game!
Up to Episode 11 of #AttackOnTitan . Drawing these on #WiiU Miiverse allows me to not only have a quick reference of where I am in the series the next time I want to catch up, but also a reminder of which scene went with which episode. I'll have to keep in mind to pick scenes that don't spoil certain events, though.
Lookin' for some experts to help us through rank 4 and 5 Room Name: Canada 04 Free D Lobby7 #MH3U #WiiU
I should probably continue #PandorasTower but it's difficult to not simply fritter away all my gaming free-time on #MH3U instead #WiiU
Tried catching the fleas off the back of a Zinogre, according to that video. Some of its fur got caught in my net instead. #MH3U #WiiU

Can we all agree that EA are douches now? | EA Developing Frostbite Engine For Mobile, But Not Wii U j.mp/14mBSbU #WiiU #Development #EA
Got Super Metroid for 30 cents on the #WiiU eShop today.
Going to try continuing this today, if I can tear myself away from Monster Hunter! #PandorasTower #WiiU Tower 02
A little rough on quality, but hopefully it'll improve over time. #PandorasTower #WiiU Tower 01
Gotta love the people loudly proclaiming "I'm gonna hold off on buying a #WiiU or #3DS because the latest Nintendo Direct didn't announce the one first party game that I've been "hoping for". And when it does, they're like "Oh but I'm not going to buy a system for just that one game." You could make a whole Phoenix Wright spinoff series based on how much the Nintendo-haters contradict themselves. #NintendoDirect
I'm thinking about picking up Injustice, or at least budgeting for it next month. It's too bad that they had to release it at the same time as Soul Hackers and Pandora's Tower. I'll probably be spending any time not already spent Monster Hunting, on those two. #WiiU #Injustice #InjusticeGame #InjusticeGodsAmongUs #Gaming #SoulHackers #ShinMegamiTensei #3DS #PandorasTower #Wii
Who would have thought that those ugly, annoying Bnahabra could become something so classy-looking? #MH3U #WiiU #3DS
Okay, I think it might be time to start making dung bombs, when large monsters start coming after you one after the next when all you want to do is gather ingredients for Mega Potions! GEEZ! #MH3U #MonsterHunter #WiiU #3DS
A quick tip I've learned for gathering. Either take a full stack of something, or just one. #MonsterHunter #MH3U #WiiU #3DS
I've started transferring my flipnotes to Youtube in preparations for the big move to Flipnote Studio 3D. Undecided on transferring the earlier stuff... #Hatena #Animation #3DS #Nintendo #Youtube #Flipnote
I might have to take a break from #MH3U to take part in Friday Night Ninja Fights! #NG3RE #WiiU #Gaming #Gamers
Now that they're putting an enhanced version of the Dungeons and Dragons arcade games on the Wii U eShop, let's see if they can port their manic-shooters over, too. I'd pay a stack of quarters to play this on Wii U or 3DS with online cooperation and worldwide leaderboards that can be sorted by region or friend-list! Make that two stacks of quarters for the online stuff! #3ds #WiiU #eShop #Nintendo #gaming #DungeonsAndDragons #WizardsOfTheCoast #Capcom
Today was not a peaceful day for gathering honey in the woods. #MH3U #MonsterHunter #WiiU #gaming #gamers
