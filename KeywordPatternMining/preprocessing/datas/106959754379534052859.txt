I am currently a proud owner of Xperia Z,Z1 and tablet Z. Only complaint I have currently is that despite all hype and advertising about Z1,the camera can't take 20.7mp resolution on auto. I had to use manual mode. It's processing software needs improvement especially the oversampling and low light photography really sucks in auto mode...come on Sony you claimed Z1 to be no.1 in camera phone for android platform...release a proper update for the camera software the rest about kit kat 4.4 I am not bothered much....just fix the camera!!
I am currently having z ultra too..that makes me your loyal customer...
