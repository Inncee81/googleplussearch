Whatever you do...WHATEVER YOU DO.....don't become emotionally invested in any character....EVER. And don't blink...
Do we really think fingerprint scanning is going to catch on this time? All I am seeing are article about how great it is, but we have been down this road before, and it flopped so bad that most people don't remember we went down this road before. There just seems to be a lot of....useless innovation in the market over the past several months.
I was addicted to the Atari 2600 version. I was not a regular arcade dweller until well after the video game crash and rebound. Sure the 2600 version was buggy, looked horrific, and controls were next to impossible...but that was the charm of video games back then.
+ Bikash Shrestha I found it yesterday on the Verizon HTC One variant of PAC rom. It was not hidden on this one. I am a bit ashamed of how fast I died....stupid ghosts.....
I like the idea of a flexible display. It could be much more break-resistant than what we currently have. And the future idea of fold-able phones is a very nice one. What I don't see is the need for this generation of curved phones. They are not break-resistant, they don't offer anything in the way of improvement with the screen shape. At least the LG one mimics the shape of a real phone.
