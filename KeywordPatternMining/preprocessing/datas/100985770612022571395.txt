Well... Isn't that what MS and Sony are already doing? With Glass and PS mobile?
Well just saying... Its more of a forced move in order to keep up. Nintendo still playing catch up. Every aspect of this console has been limping to keep up with its competition.
Eventually it will and I'm sure better. Its in play with that game Destiny (a game that will probably never see a Nintendo console) I'm sure eventually more 1st and 3rd party developers will be doing this. Beyond what the Wii U can. And who's to say Sony and MS aren't working out the same deals, just keeping under wraps until they launch their systems. I mean Microsoft has its own phones and mobile OS. Sony manufactures phones that run Android.... Its all in the plans I'm pretty sure. It would be wasted opportunity and revenue if it wasn't.
