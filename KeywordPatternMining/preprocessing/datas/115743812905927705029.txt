Dang, I was hoping for a bigger battery. I know it's not official but this G2 battery life is cray and I want the same cray in my future N5. Cray.
Manager showed me dumby nexus 5. Said not to say anything about it or even describe it to anyone. It was magical.

Moobs. We've all been there.
I was able to get a ticket gifted to me, but unfortunately no. It's a 7 hour trip that I just can't make this year. Next year for sure + Nathan Amos
It will be the first one I've missed. Pretty bummed.
Same here
