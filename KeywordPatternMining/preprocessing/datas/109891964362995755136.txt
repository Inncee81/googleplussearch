Tablets are nice but the Xperia Z Ultra has got me more than intrigued. As in ditching Samsung without a second thought intrigued. PLEASE make a "play edition" stock android one + Sony so I can just jump bandwagon and justify skipping my upgrade period!

I might not like the XBone premise all together, but I have to say that the controller looks outstanding.
The more I see of Knack, the more interested I am in it.
Played like GoW? Now I didn't expect that at all... again I'm more interested.
