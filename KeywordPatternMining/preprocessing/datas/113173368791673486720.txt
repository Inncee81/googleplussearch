Nice... what carrier are you with? Saw the specs on it; Sony or Motorola might be my next picks for a phone if I'm disappointed with Samsung's products when the time comes. Loved the reliability of Moto and liked the cameras on Sony phones when I had them.
Thanks John. I'm with T-Mobile as well and will look into the Z1. Sorry to hear about the camera...
Really?!? + nurse angie , + John M Catral , the posts you two post... Actually has the makings of a good commercial. Now, what to sell, what to sell?
