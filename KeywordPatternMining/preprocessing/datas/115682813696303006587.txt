Not considering myself an expert but here's my thoughts: Is this a global product or built for a particular market? The distance of monitoring centers would matter with all the non GSM options. The power and antenna requirements would also be significantly greater if you were to switch to another type of radio. If it is just an emergency broadcast it could be done without a Sim card and just a gsm modem using much lower power. (Still depending on cellular infrastructure)
+ Puleen Patel Sure, shoot me an email and I'll definitely try to guide them as much as I can (they may be past the stage of what I can do). Do they have an engineer on the team? hardware by any chance? Definitely down for a round of beers now that summer is settling down and 'most' of my traveling is complete.
