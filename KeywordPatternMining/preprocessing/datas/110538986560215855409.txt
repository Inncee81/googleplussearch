I, too, was a news junkie. I got burned out recently, especially after last years' exhausting election coverage. I'd like to think I'm a person that makes his opinion after looking over many rationals and so my RSS feeds are filled with both right, left, center, and conspiracy nut. That also is exhausting. I was so bummed when I heard Google was shutting Google Reader down. Instead of visiting 90 sites, I could curate it all on one, and they did it well. I use Feedly as a replacement right now. As soon as Google Reader shuts down, I guess they'll keep your feed lists on their servers and authenticate your login with Google.
