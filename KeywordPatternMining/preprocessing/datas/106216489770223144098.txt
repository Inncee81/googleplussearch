A very helpful review Gordon. I appreciate the attention to detail - really stands out. There are many long reviews nowadays but few get to the heart of using a camera. Your notes on EVF ratios were particularly useful. As a "long timer" with the E-M5 / without grip / can you tell me how you hold it? I've tried and find my thumb is too far away from the rear dial to reach it. And the right-hand strap lug gets in the way too. In what watts have you adapted your grip?
ASP-C ILCs will feel the squeeze at the top end.
