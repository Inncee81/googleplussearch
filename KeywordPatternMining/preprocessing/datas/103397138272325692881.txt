The apps should tell you how much data has been used ,,, YouTube is the biggest on mine so I try not watching YouTube videos while using data / 3G
If you move the white sliders along it should just pull up those apps in that section ,, might be able to pinpoint the app easier.
Just been looking online at the problem , the main one that keeps coming back is that an app is being , or has been downloaded but the download was cancelled but Android OS is still trying to download it in the background
Still trying to find out more about this. It sounds like Android is calling home it could be backing up data to Googles servers ,,,, Settings / Backup & Reset untick the backup data part then see if that helps Also check Google apps ,, G+ instant upload switched off , Google Currents , sync switched off those sorts of things. Also could you check your Ram usage see if any apps are using an excessive amount of Ram. might give us a clue to what may be going on.
