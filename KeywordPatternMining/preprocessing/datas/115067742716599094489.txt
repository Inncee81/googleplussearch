Buying this camera just don't know which one, probably the A7 the reduced mp will allow me to use more of my old lenses. In your review please share if the lenses are also weather sealed
Every NEX shooter should grab this lens, I don't know if 120mm is too compressed for normal use on a m43
Fuji's Golden Angel that was walking around the Digital Show was being used to pimp that camera, the results are much better than I excepted. I should of asked to handle it. Is it made of metal?
I really like the egg in darkness
The light pepper would be really cool if there were a lots of them
I really like the aperture ring on the lens,
I'm impressed than, both Sony's and Canon's consumer versions I've used are much weaker, good work Olympus and Blunty for the meircats
At this point I'm waiting for the omd em6, really want that IS but no peaking or pal frame rates are keeping me away
