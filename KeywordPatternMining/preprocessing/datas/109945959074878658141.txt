If you're making money you're a good photographer : ) If one is doing it for art then I don't think such a concept of good or bad exists for art. At least that's my point of view on any form of art. One simply does what inspires them.
haha okay Steve. I get what you're saying. But me or you may think something is bad but if it's what a client wants then...
