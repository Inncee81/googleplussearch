The Z1 has been announced for US Market today, see
I took my Z1 with me in the shower today. The sceen clicked automaticly when hit by the water stream. I think it works better in water with constant pressure. Just sharing my discover ;)
+ Stefan Svartling well, twittering from the shower takes your life to a whole new level ;)
+ Maximilian Y. actually it did, but it had some random tapping on the screen. I was able to tweet with it. Not flawless thou.
+ Stefan Svartling have you noticed that when in a call on the phone, you cant for example write text messages? it seems that you can start programs but not doing anything. or is it just my Z1 ? :/
