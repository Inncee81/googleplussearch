Definitely going to review this lens! The Nano technology and the focus limiting is all I can see really that is new. It says high speed tracking support enhanced also, but that is very vague. I would not bother upgrading until it's been proven to be worth it + Klaus Binder
It's clearly not worth upgrading then from what it sounds like. If you don't have the 70-200mm lens, this one should have slight edge over the old one ;) + Klaus Binder
Yeah the big boys are crazy expensive! Like a car almost;)
Sony is saving th IBIS for the A-Mount Pro cameras apparently + Mike Hendren + Cody Sims
I don't like the way it looks at all. Perhaps it will grow on me? the shutter button looks so weird?
It totally does + Darren Krusi Like they bolted on a grip and viewfinder.
