So, we're assuming Hangouts is going to function like GoSMS or Handcent in that it will be able to access the phone's carrier provided SMS services/database... If so, will I be able to send/receive SMS messages on my tablet, desktop, etc like I can with current hangout messages?
Except it looks to be running 4.5 - I doubt that has been certified to run on Verizon's network... best knock it down to a tested and stable 2.3 to get it allowed in the network... it can be OTA'd later, once enough bloatware has been baked into it, all possible root exploits blocked, the bootloader locked tighter than Fort Knox, etc...
D'oh... my bad.... here's my pocket protector... I'm no longer worthy of wearing it... lost too many geek points....
