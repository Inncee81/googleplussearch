dont you think there will be a problem with the slide? because if you open the apps section if you slide to the left you go to categories, or to the right go to top paid and other stuff. I always thought thats why the play store didnt have the slide menu
So if i understand correctly, the "google experience" is like... a google launcher? So the nexus will have the google launcher for default (or maybe will have the AOSP launcher and the google experience one?) and me with a samsung or motorola will be able to download the google launcher?
im afraid this means the app drawer will be white instead of black. Just think about it, look at the new download icon. If the app drawer is white...you would be able to see the ciclre and the arrow, just the "filler" space between them, al least on amoled screens (because if something is black, the leds dont turn on). So i think that the app drawer now has to be a color other than black, and based on the notification bar, white is my guess. It looks like android will become a black & white OS (more white than black) now. Wich personaly i dont think it will be a good idea. Based on the hangouts leak i can see that the google apps will still have color, but the AOSP ones im afraid not.
