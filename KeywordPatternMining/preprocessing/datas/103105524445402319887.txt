Already bought the phone but to those who intend to buy it just dont expect this phone to be 100%perfect....but still it is one of the FEW greatest smartphones available in the market
Sony xperia z1 camera takes much better pics without the flash....with flash ...urghh
By the way it has been a week since i bought the Z1 n it is one heck of a smartphone...great job Sony
I dont wanna put my Z1 into the water unless necessary
So far i haven't tried soaking my Z1...maybe soon hehe
Why is it when a picture taken with the flash on look way tooo bright on the right side of the picture...had the same prob with the Z before
Thanx for the tips Rachell of Sony
Used to own Z too...now with Z1 no more problem with battery life
I still prefer using Manual most of the time...better pics
Yes...but Manual for smartphone camera is not like the one in DSLR camera....limited setting but worth taking your time to get better pics than using AUTO mode
Speaker sound could be better Sony....there's room for improvement
Agree with u...did the same comparison too
