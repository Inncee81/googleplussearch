Yea... sometime the best smart phone do not sell... Unless the media tells the sheep they need it.
They are great phone.... I have used all the top smart phones and the new BB10's are just as good and better in some ways.
BB needs to bring their prices down... It's a good move!
I have an iPhone, The galaxy note 2 and now the Z10 (I will be upgrading to the Z30). I know 1st hand that the BB10's are faster at getting stuff done and if your a gamer the Z10 is awesome. I have not touched any of me other 2 phones in weeks... They just do not cut it for me.
