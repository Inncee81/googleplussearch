Quite ironic the question you asked as I have always loved photos and photography. My first camera Was a point and shoot and last week i decided to buy my first dslr, i have bought a entry level model and I have decided to take a course in photography. I bought a nikon d3200 with the kit lens and i also bought a 55-200 lens. I am really enjoying the learning process
