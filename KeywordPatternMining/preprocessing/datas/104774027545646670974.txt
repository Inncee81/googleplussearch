Congrats! Best day of the year to get married! (Mine also lol)
Cheers. I hope you and your wife had a wonderful day also! We snuck out to the winery where we had our reception.
I have one I use from an old MX combo, love the keyboard but it's large.
The new watch? I'd love to hear your review after a few days.
Still have mine after 4 days... lol. Haven't found a protector yet.
