It was one of my Grandads old cameras - a Kodak, I can't remember the model but it had no controls what so ever and those square flash bulbs that I'm sure damaged your retinas.......
I love these kind of rides, just my level! I think there's an Edwardian fair that travels around the country, I'd love to go visit that!!!
One day I'll bump into you around New Brighton + Gordon Laing !!! LOL!
