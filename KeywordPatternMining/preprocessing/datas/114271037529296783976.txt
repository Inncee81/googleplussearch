Slow samsung devices? What are you talking about?
Don't care about snapdragons and shit.. I just want smooth, fast, fluid experience .. and right now my s4 flies.. Lolï»¿ + Rojah Urban
There goes the tw hate like the lg skin is any better.. Bitch please, tw is one of the most stable ROM out there.. It's come long way since s2...also don't get why people would trade stability for shitass ROM cyanogen.. Tried it on my s4 and it was buggy as shit. If i wanted a featureless phone, i would go for nexus. I got rid of samsung bloats which was enough to make my phone fly..
