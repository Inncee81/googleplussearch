Oh, please make a 'MDR-10RNCBT' in the near future. I would really like a noise-cancelling around-ear Bluetooth headphone.
The Sony announcement simply put a stop to planning further investments into my MFT kit. Instead of upgrading to a 1000€ GX7 oder a 1500€ E-M1 I am now looking into getting an A7. Of course I would need new lenses with that but then I would mainly use this camera in the low focal length range and I haven't yet bought a MFF wide angle lens. So an A7 with a Canon 14-40 mm L lens plus a Metabones adaptor looks like a nice kit for me Since I would be shooting primarily wide angle with that setup, I'm also not concerned about lens weight and sizes. The wide angle kit sketched above should only weight 100-200 g more than my G3 plus Panasonic 100-300 mm lens - which I will keep for zoo photography etc.
+ Mario van Antwerpen Not every MFT lens is automatically much more compact than a FF lens. For example: My current Panasonic 14-140 mm lens weights 460 g, has a length of 84 mm and a diameter of 70 mm. If Tamron should ever decide to adapt their FF capable 28-300 mm lens for E-Mounts, then I will happily go for this lens, which is actually 40 g less heavy, has the same length and only 3 mm more diameter.
+ Neil Howard You're right. I still have one of these incredibly small MFT powerzooms at home because it came as part of a kit. But actually I never used it at all One area that remains undisputed though is long telephoto lenses. I won't feel comfortable lugging around a full frame 400 mm lens while traveling/hiking.
My own thoughts after reading about the E-M1: personally I don't need the weather sealing, better in-body stabilisation, and FT AF compatibility, so I can save quite some money by getting a GX7 instead.

Nice one, although the price asked is way off for me. I would rather throw in a few hundred dollars more, forget its wide zoom range and faster lens, and go for the full frame A7 kit instead. And keep my RX100 as my EDC compact camera
+ Ingo Meckmann Here's another (overall very enthusiastic) video review of the A7/A7R mentioning the loud shutter: Sony A7 & A7R Hands-On Field Test
Anyone having good Sony-internal contacts around here? While doing the pre-order process I found out that the A7 kit will available exactly ten day too late here in Germany for me to take it on my next trip to New Zealand. I would really like to shoot with it there but unfortunately Sony Germany would neither deliver a german order to a NZ address...
+ Mark Spearman As the review states, there are several models available offering 1200 mm FF-equivalent at the long end. What's so special about the FZ72 is that the lens is starting at an ultrawide 20 mm FF-equivalent.
+ Michael Vogt Don't circle me then, I'll be there soon too. 24 days left until take-off
