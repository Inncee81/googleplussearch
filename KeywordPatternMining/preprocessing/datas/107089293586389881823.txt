I guess we won't know until it's official but from the renders/photo's we've seen so far it looks like the N5 has quite sharp edges to the bezel. Surely they wouldn't do away with the N4's curved edges?
Considering the app drawer write up we had today can we consider this video to be of an older build then? That and the KLP reference.
+ Artem Russakovskii Opps! So you did. I was too excited to read. Had to watch the video. I will pay more attention from here on in
Begs the question is this an old build or an old video? If it is an old video why sit on it for so long?
Could well be this is one of their videos that will be released once it's official. Much like Carphone Warehouse put out. I was assuming this was some sort of fan site of SFR, I guess we have a company person leaking it then. Thank you faceless person!
You can tell it's old hardware as all the original leaks had a bare back to the phone. All the later leaks revealed the Nexus branding. This has no branding.
