I think the "problem" is, that G+ grows loud. Let me explain this thought: The now big and widely accepted networks are a couple of years old. In the beginning they were growing slow - slower than G+. But back then near to nobody heard of them (they were growing silent) and so nobody could have looked at it and said "Oh there is nobody, so this network will die quickly!". But Google makes sure that everybody knows about G+, so it grows loud and so there are people who see a young network as dying (or already dead) because it has only few users. G+ is only 2.5 years old - calm down and let's see ...
I don't have the "more G+-posts" - "all websites" - toggle - button on www.google.de But nevertheless there are a few posts shown up.
It seems that this is not depending from .com .se or .de - it doesn't work on any (for me). Even changing the language to english doesn't work ... :/ Why is this button so limited?
