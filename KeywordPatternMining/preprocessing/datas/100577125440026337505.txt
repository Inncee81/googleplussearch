Me neither, but the news itself got me smiling so much it hurts in my ears
Seems like this update will finally shut me up about the camera shortcomings in the reviews I read - hopefully (and most likely), this is the software update that will make the camera the undisputable top dog among the critics too + Stefan Svartling
+ Stefan Svartling I know, but you ain't among the cameras/phones critics
LOL, that's not proof of anything else than it's a good camera, and of your subjective opinion. Which is nowhere near objective. I didn't mention it to discuss with you once more, but because I saw that the camera fixes was in the update. And from what we can see there - Sony is clearly admiting there was some problems by updating it without adding any new camera features. I don't want this discussion again anyway - have a nice day.
+ Stefan Svartling Are you kidding me? That's something I expected from my 7 years old cousin in a discussion. I'm sorry, but if you can't take the heat of a discussion without fishing for support from your followers, that tells me all I need to know. It's time to stop discussing with you, because you clearly are the owner of the truth. And the other comments in the thread you're linking to was about your images, not about the camera issues and the reviews btw. All I ever said about the camera is that it dissapointed a little (just like the reviews all over the Internet), but not because of the hardware - it's the software. Which Sony just updated. I never said it's a bad camera, I never said it ain't among the best, and maybe even the best. Why so defensive? Your definition of facts are astonishing btw.
LOL, I don't even own an iPhone (gave it to my wife), and I'm not going to switch back to it this year either. And it's not my opinion, it's the reviewers opinion - I haven't touched the iPhone 5S yet! Neihter have you! Your approach to this is: I'm right, no one else are more compitent on the subject, not even the profesional photographers. That's hardly subjective...
+ Andrew Farmer Cool, let me know when you've compared it. What + Stefan Svartling is not understanding is that I'm not trying to bash the Z1, which I own myself, neither am I trying to be an iPhone fanboy - I just repeated the average of the reviews I read, and of the tests with both phones. And to be clear - the reviews never said the iPhone was the clear winner, but most of them was about how good the iPhone was in comparison when thinking about the difference in hardware, and in some areas - better. Some made the iPhone 5S the winner, some made Z1 the winner. But almost all of them was writing about the software issues this camera got.
+ Stefan Svartling I am testing it myself, and I am enjoying it, but like I've said a couple of times by now - I have not been able to test the iPhone 5S myself yet. Therefor I have to read the reviews/tests to get a real comparison in the same situations/locations. And even though I'm enjoying the camera, it has its weaknesses. I've experienced a couple of them myself. But all phones, or most of them at least, has some problems after the release. Software updates like this is the saviour. You can enjoy a device without going all fanboyisme on it you know...
Didn't Sony do the same thing with the Xperia Z1? Leave out the OIS in the camera? It's good to have, but you can manage without it I think. The size of that thing is more of a problem for me. But that's pretty subjective
+ Stefan Svartling . Ok. The large amount of megapixels probably makes that possible and pretty smooth anyway.
I can't get over the power this thing got (Z1), it's the fastest phone I've had my fingers on to this day, by a large margin...
Beautiful pictures + Stefan Svartling , let there be no doubt about that. But I never said that the Z1 won't take nice pictures, just that a lot of the reviews I read where a little dissapointed with the performance of the camera in relation to that 20 megapixels among other things. And that the iPhone 5S did just as good, and actually a little better in average. You still havent tested the iPhone 5S, right? Luckily, the reviews tested both phones for us! I'm all open for the opposite, but the average of the reviews I've been reading have been like this. I love my Z1 myself, but havent tested the camera to the full extent yet. What's the difference anyway? If you love your phone and camera, and get pictures like you posted here, why bother arguing if it's better or not than an other smartphone?
Of course you are, I've learned to know you by now. Who are these profesionall photographers reviewing these devices, when we amateurs can dismiss their reviews by saying - I'm sure they are wrong! Especially when you havent used both devices yourself? You obviously more informed on photography than anyone else, good to know! Enjoy your camera and phone, really. It's good, and your pictures are very good. But as long as you don't take input from other sources than your stubborn mind, you're pretty much lost in a discussion. #stubbornness + Andreas Lanjerud
real mature to answer questions with a laugh, you haven't answered those questions once yet. Not in the previous discussion, and not here. Why are you so confident in this when other reviewers are not, and when other users are not? And what's the difference for you when you like the camera anyway - is it that important to convince yourself that it's the best? I just don't get it...
What about the real life use? Why do you think the profesionalls mostly disagree with you? What background do you have to bash them? Remember, you haven't tried both phones - they have, and they have the knowledge to judge it the right way. The Sony Xperia Z1 Camera is totally winning if hardware is what we are talking about, but in real life use it's not that obvious because of the software issues...
I think we'll have to agree to disagree + Stefan Svartling , but I really don't understand your stubborness. Have a nice day, and like I said - i really liked your images
The Z1 camera has been said to be the best when it comes to good lightening, but the low light performance was not that good in almost every review I've been reading. What do you really mean by DSLR-like effect? You have control over aparture/ISO/etc - which is very nice, but it's nothing like a DSLR. + Vikas Shah I agree with you - both phones are amazing when it comes to the camera, and users will be more than happy with both. That is why I don't understand why it's so important for Stefan to convince me that the average of the reviews/tests on the phones are wrong. I'm a happy Z1 owner myself btw.
From what I can see from the reviews and (camera) tests I've read, both phones have their moments in different areas. But most of the reviews expected a little more from Z1s cam with its megapixels. But it seems like most of the cons can be fixed by software updates from Sony. The iPhone 5 is actually doing a little better in a lot of the reviews. This is a good example of a well done test of the best camera phones now: Btw + Stefan Svartling , I bought the Xperia Z1 yesterday, and so far I'm loving it. But have you noticed any problems with the flash of the camera? Each time I'm using the flash the image gets washed out...
Well, there are moments where the flash is necessary, where not using it actually will destroy the image. And if you look at the iPhone images where the flash was used from the test I posted above, you can see that the flash doesn't destroy the image there. I'm pretty confident Sony will update and fix the small amount of problems it have in an update pretty soon. Then it will be the to dog in my opinion
One thing that is often forgotten when mentioning the 64bit CPU of 5s is the security boost it comes with...
That's not a very well done camera review (it was only a part of the review of course) in my opinion - nothing in that review show the reader really why the blogger means it is a mostly better camera! No pictures, no explaination of what he thinks is good or bad, not a lot of facts other than specs. Like I said, I'm not talking about only one review/test, but the average of a whole lot of reviews I've read - and most of them puts iPhone as the top dog, and are a little dissapointed of the Z1 camera (expected a lot more from it). There's no problem searching Google for an other opinion to make a point come across, but that's not showing the average opinion of the reviewers
You don't agree that most of the reviews I've read placed iPhone 5s as the top dog, and was a little disappointed of Z1? Good to know, but not really a problem of my that you only believe things that support your own opinion. ... Feel free to post a couple of well done tests which claims that, to make the average a little different for me, but please stay away from blogger reviews without any expertise (from blogs you probably never visited before). Most of them are only opinion based and doesn't add any facts to the table.
So you have an opinion on something you haven't tried, and you don't believe the reviews...
I find the Z1 camera very good this far, but not crazy good. But I really like the total experince of this device, better than any other Android phone by now.
Me neither, but the news itself got me smiling so much it hurts in my ears

So, where are those who used every available article/rumor about the Nexus 5 to point out that it would never be named the Nexus 5, but the Nexus 4 once again. Laughed then... still laughing!
