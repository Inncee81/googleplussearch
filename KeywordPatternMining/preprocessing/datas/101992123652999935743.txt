Nice work, Gino. Really enjoyed the set.
Dude...you're smokin'. (I mean that in the least creepy way possible.) So freaking cool.
Good to hear, good to hear.
Awesome shot, Barasa. I know exactly what you're talking about with the service at major places. But man...that shot is just fantastic. Ratcliff-esque (Ratcliffian?), if I may say so, sir.
