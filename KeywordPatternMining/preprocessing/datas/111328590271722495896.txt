I just bought Swype. I will give it a couple of weeks. I still think the Xperia keyboard on my Z1 is really good.
I will + Stefan Svartling . One thing I just discovered is that Swype doesn't switch language by it self like the Xperia keyboard does.
Thank you + Stefan Svartling . That's was easy. On the Xperia keyboard I just Swype and it works without changing any settings. But I think I can get used to this to.
