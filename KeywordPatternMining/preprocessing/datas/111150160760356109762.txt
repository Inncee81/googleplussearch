Beautiful. I'm planning a trip to Iceland. Any suggestion if I should go in winter or summer?
+ Jean-Pierre Lavoie thanks for the suggestion Jean-Pierre, did you have the opportunity to visit the crystal cave under the glaciers? That's why I was asking about winter.
+ Jake Radomsky good point Jake because I was really interested in the crystal caves and the northern lights
#delete9 an HDR of this photo would be great
