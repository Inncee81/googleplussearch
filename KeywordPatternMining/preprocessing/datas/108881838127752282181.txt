It's probably just due to running out of storage space, you have to keep like 2GB+ free at all times or that thing slows to a crawl. Either that or your disk is super fragmented, the new TRIM support should help there. Either way, it has absolutely nothing to do with the GPU...
If you wanna be mad at someone it would be Asus... The original N7 definately had some big build issues, but in their defence, the 2013 N7's are a whole new class of quality, they improved immensely.
The first thing I'd try is to free up some space, get yourself to 5GB free, and see if the issues don't just sorta resolve themself. These sorts of extreme slowdown are almost always due to storage fragmentation, it doesn't have much to do with the CPU/GPU combo, basically your chips are sitting idle, waiting on data from the internal memory, which is completely fragged and slow.
Also, make sure you have Android 4.3, plugin and leave overnight, FSTRIM should run and might help a lot.
Ya I'm not sure, but they do have different usage patterns, maybe whatever you do with your N4 doesn't fragment the HDD as much as the N&. Or maybe the N4 got Android 4.3 sooner, or gets plugged in more, and has been running TRIM every night, where your tablet has not...
Ya I just looked it up, and that's the goal. There's a few conditions: * In Sleep mode for >1hr * Plugged in w/ 30% charge, or unplugged with 80%. * Hasn't run in the last 24hrs If you plug it in each night, in theory it should run each night or two.
