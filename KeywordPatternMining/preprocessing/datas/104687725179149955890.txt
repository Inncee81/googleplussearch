does have a large device like the note3 and the much larger but similarly themed note 10.1 seem redundant, considering that they can in fact serve much of the same purposes?
....Okay, so im gunna go with a No... it doesnt feel redundant having two devices of the same nature at those varying size footprints?
Guess its an individual preference thing... I couldnt do the 4 and 7, but the 4 and 10 ... yes... or the note and the N7 sure... but in my eyes they serve different needs... Currently I rock the S3 and the N10 ... but Im itching to upgrade... What can I say, I got a thing for the cutting edge, latest and greatest
