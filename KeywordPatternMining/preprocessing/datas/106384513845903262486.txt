Yeah... I saw this the other day and let's just say I'm skeptical about the pricing, especially since Valve is talking about using 3rd party manufacturers to make the actual Steam Machines.
+ Richard Dixon The impression I get from is that they're only making the prototype boxes and 3rd parties will handle the actual mass production models. I don't know if Valve has the infrastructure to handle mass produced hardware.
It's possible that they limited the pre-order stock on purpose. We won't really know what's going on until well after the system launches.
