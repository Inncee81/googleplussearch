I still shoot predominantly stills w/ my GH3 and there are times where I feel the midtones to shadow transition could be better. Plus, the E-M1 really took all that's great w/ the E-M5 and made it so much better. I'm very, very tempted. Anyone want to buy a 5 month old GH3 + battery grip, lol?
I've used the VF4 viewfinder with the EP5 and it's definitely better than GH3. I also tried GX7 and while the color is great, it tears and the viewfinder is not as good as the VF4
