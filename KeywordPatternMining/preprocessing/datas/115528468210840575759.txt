Enough to tempt you away from m43 + Gordon Laing ?
Looking at them side-by-side the size advantage of the m4/3 camera has all but disappeared. At least with the lenses being compared. I'm sure a 35 1.8 on the Sony would be noticeably bigger but then it's also a totally different proposition on a FF camera. I think it will take a couple of years when there's a good selection of native FE lenses to see how they really stack up. Anyone with a collection of old manual focus primes will likely love this camera - concerns about loud shutter and vignetting notwithstanding. And many of those lenses are pretty small so should not feel/look unbalanced on the Sony
I use the silent shutter on my 5D Mk3 almost all the time and I love the feature. But at this price point I think I'll forgive the loud shutter of the new Sony. A small, capable full-frame camera at a reasonable price is something I've been waiting to see for a good while and my first impressions are very positive. There are some advanced features but the design is essentially minimalist - which is a good thing in my book. It remains to be seen how good the overall package including lenses etc is. For me the biggest negative now is the battery life. But carrying a few spares is a lot less weight than the big Canon and Nikon glass needed on a FF DSLR. Well done Sony (I've never said that before!)
+ Ingo Meckmann The shutter used is a mechanical, focal plane shutter so I don't think firmware can fix this - unless they can slow it down. As far as I know there's no silent option that uses an electronic shutter. I guess this could be added in firmware - manufacturers have been known to add features this way to existing cameras. It's hard to say why the mechanical shutter is so loud compared to other mirrorless cameras, most of which also use focal plane shutters as far as I know. Of course this one is larger than most. The silent shutter in the 5D Mk3 is really quiet and that also includes the mirror slap. So it certainly should be possible to make a FF mirrorless camera with a virtually silent shutter. For now I think street-photographers will have to look elsewhere.... maybe the new Leica M 240 (anyone wanna buy a kidney?!)
