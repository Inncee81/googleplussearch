I'm on my PC browsing nexus 5. Seems to talk a lot about the 16gb variant at 350$. 2300mAh. Nothing about 32, at least officially. Nor 3000mAh sadly
A lot of leaks and rumors. Nothing concrete. Waiting to see what they have to say. And if it comes to Telus and you want it, let me know...
Not on the Canadian play store unfortunately. So until it'd there and I can purchase it...
Here's an other Samsung sheep. How about we get the phone we WANT instead of your blinded view of cell phones? I'm not taking anything away from the note 3. Its a great device. But your comment is just absurd and shouldn't even be here...
Wow, you are horrible at writing... Do you know how to properly use a period or a comma? Holy crap... Secondly, some people don't like touchwiz, or like being forced using Samsung specific apps and like to be given the choice. I could go on and on but you are clearly close minded... People say iSheep are bad, so are Samsung loyalists...
You've just been muted and blocked maicos. I don't have time to waste with people like you
+ Bradley Arfele I agree. Though I've been noticing this trend for Samsung phones, defending it more so than people with iPhones. That right there is saying something. A lot of nexus users are the same way as well. Just have to try and weed through the bullshit.
