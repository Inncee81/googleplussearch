As much as I hate them as a company their service is incredible... And I took advantage of the unlimited data loophole the other week
+ Joshua Culver almost three weeks ago there was a " glitch" on their website that allowed you to renew your contract and keep unlimited data. It lasted around 18 hours and people were scared that Verizon would not honor the contract and would force you to tiered data. But Verizon stated the next day they would honor those contracts. So I got a shiny new note3!
