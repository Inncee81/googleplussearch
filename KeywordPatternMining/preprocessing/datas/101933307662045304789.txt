I can't believe just how uninterested I am in Apple products nowadays. I don't like Apple, but i used to look forward to see what they did next, now they bore me!
+ Justin Herrera nothing apple do nowadays is "epic". They "borrow" others ideas and call them "innovative" and "new", which they aren't. The 64 bit chip is completely redundant on the iPhone, all its done is force the app devs to rewrite for the chip. When android devices launch with a 64bit chip, they will probably also have 4gb of ram so that they can utilise it.
