That case is far from attractive. In fact it is completely disgusting design wise. The material does a great job of protecting the device i am sure, however i remember having a case just like this one on my Nokia phone back in 1999, and i remember it being quite interfering of the buttons. I can see the extra work that goes in to pressing the home button already.
