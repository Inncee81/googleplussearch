Just brilliant stuck on M6 between J43 and J42 because someone wasn't being attentive while driving. Need to be in Blackburn by 12 noon some chance of that happening now. Lesson 1 of today, check google maps traffic before setting off.
Dancing for Spider Love This video is a wonderful display of courtship behavior by Maratus speciosus , the Peacock Spider. And has my favorite music in the second half, the didgeridoo. Mr. Jurgen Otto did the filming and put it together. H/T to + Rashmi Pahuja Maratus is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). All described species are endemic to Australia. Its best known member is the "peacock spider", M. volans. The males of most known Maratus species use colorful expanded abdominal flaps in courtship display (Otto and Hill 2011).[1] In at least one species, Maratus vespertilio, the expansion of the flaps also occurs during ritualised contests between males (Otto and Hill 2012) The information on the video is: - - - snip - - - Courtship display of the Coastal peacock spider (Maratus speciosus). Hard to believe, but there is not footage of this species yet in any wildlife documentary. It inhabits coastal dune habitats near Perth in Western Australia. Filmed by me (Jurgen Otto) with Canon 60D and 100 mm macro lens. Music in order of appearance: Fossils (Graham Pagano) Didgeridingo (David Anstey) All music from stockmusicsite.com Still images of this spider on ipernity or flickr: .. ..

What a brilliant advert for the new + Kia Motors UK + Kia Motors Worldwide carens. Very enjoyable to watch.
So what do you guys think? Ready to part with your money?
Not having any luck with phone cases for my S4. Just received a supposed genuine + Incipio ® dualpro case for my S4 meant to be brand new, obviously from the opened packaging it's been opened before. No serial number card inside, so more than likely a fake. This along with my broken possible fake + OtterBox case, a + Cruzerlite case that doesn't actually fit, even though + Cruzerlite seem to think it's fine means the only case I have that is actually genuine and fits like a glove is my genuine Samsung galaxy S4 hard case and the S view case I got with the phone. Lets see what tomorrow brings if my supposed genuine + Spigen SGP case arrives.

Perspective What a brilliant example of perspective within photography - no Photoshop or anything of that nature, just two looks at the same scene. Love it.
Galaxy S 4 Android 4.3 update rolling out. With KiKat a week or so away any hope of getting it on your S 4 anytime soon as just been quashed with the 4.3 update. Nexus devices have had it for a month or so and most of the changes for the S 4 are Samsung specific: OpenGL 3.0 Support - GALAXY GEAR Support - TRIM Support (Makes the device much faster) - ANT+ Support - Samsung KNOX Implementation (KNOX bootloader and dedicated application) - Samsung Wallet comes pre-loaded - Improved RAM management - Improved Display colour reproduction (Display looks much sharper than before) - Improved TouchWiz Launcher (Much less launcher redraws and less lag) - New Samsung Keyboard - New Samsung Browser (Full screen by default, new tab interface and more) - New Reading Mode (Optimises display for reading, used by only a few specific applications) - New Camera firmware - Minor UI tweaks (Contacts app, Flashlight Widget, dialog boxes etc) As always these updates from Samsung will roll out on a as and when basis, those of you who purchased your device direct from a network might have to sit around for a little longer until they finish messing about with it.

Homescreen to try to get a aviate code
Every time I see someone doing an amazing drawing on their note, note 2 or note 3, I realise just how powerful these devices really are. Now all I need to do is convince my wife that I do actually need the note 3
Top 5 smartphone cameras have to say I kind of agree with the results but would also include the Samsung galaxy note 2 in the honourable mentions as well, as I feel the note 2 in allot of ways is better than the S4.

Is it just me, or does it seem as if when Samsung release a new device, colour or anything really, the whole interweb seems to start some massive hate thread here there and everywhere, claiming Samsung copied this or copied that or what's the point of this that and the other. Then apple release a phone with a fingerprint scanner and the web is a wash with wonder, then along comes htc with their one max with guess what? A fingerprint scanner. Does the interweb start with the copycat crap? No it starts praising their products. Lg come out with their curved display and do we have the why what's the point brigade? No instead the opposite. I give up with tech people I really do. Not happy with one concept and overly happy with someone else's take on exact same thing.
Could very well be right there m8. I see no need in 90% of what is said knocking Samsung only to praise another manufacturer for doing the exact same thing.
Good morning! Perspective: first you have to get above the air - then your ship can go fast enough to stay in orbit.
+ OtterBox + Cruzerlite surely a brand new + OtterBox case for my S4 Shouldn't break like this taking it off the phone, nor should the + Cruzerlite case fit so badly it can't even be used. Was taking the otterbox one off to try the cruzerlite one on complete disaster so back to my genuine Samsung one which of course as you can see fits perfectly. Sorry but done with expensive bad quality products from both above manufacturers.
You bet I am complete crap from supposed reputed companies making top line products. Will just stick with Samsung official gear as at least it fits like a glove and looks nice to boot
Used to be twitter but for the last few months it's Google+ by along way. Hardly ever go on twitter now and almost never on facebook unless I get a notification. Google+ is just some much better filled with useful funny informative stuff daily. Never get board looking on google+
Nothing as yet, but mine is a three network branded one, so may take a while for it to come through, although something I was told yesterday regarding the galaxy gear in the three store, did make me wonder if an update was maybe immanent.
And now lets wait and see how many people slag it off for having a curved display which seemingly if you listen or read their nonsense, is pointless on a phone, or the anti Samsung brigade, who will now claim that Samsung copied LG as they did with apple by producing a gold phone. Not that any of them said the same about the gold HTC one shown just recently. I like the idea of curved bendable displays, that are more or less unbreakable, but seems many others like the fact they can break their screens.
Still have both sat in a box full of Ericsson and Sony Ericsson phones, must be 30 or more in the collection.
Could very well be my next device, love the look of the LG G2 and the spec, but ended up going for the S4 as I do prefer Samsung products, but am very tempted by the nexus 5.
