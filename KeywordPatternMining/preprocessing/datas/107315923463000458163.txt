I tried this launcher for a few months and though is smooth it just doesn't allow the customization I need to make it worthwhile. I like how it changes based on my location but I'm not a yelp or foursquare user so again it doesn't really benefit me. I think this is a great launcher for those who want something simple and functional. It's just not for me.
I'm so ready for this
+ Stefan Svartling the curved phone concept seems more like a novelty to me than something useful. I think a curved TV or even 10 inch tablet may be useful. But a phone? Nah.
I definitely think it applies to wearable devices. But I can't see it taking off on smartphones
I agree my friend, this is a very old prototype. Retail will look far more refined. I think the camera will be ok not up to the level of the Z1. I think the screen will be beautiful, love the speaker placement (I hope its true stereo and not like the iPhone5s where it's just one speaker). I hope that they use the onboard language processing core in the Snapdragon 800 so we get "Always listening", I think the "Ok Google" change to Google Now was in preparation for this. Of course I am more excited for 4.4 than I am for the actual hardware but I think it's definitely a huge hardware bump if not just for LTE alone.
