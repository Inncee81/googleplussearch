+ Stuart Mcgregor That picture of a spider you posted up. This is the same but different colour by the looks of it. Not a great PIC, in a rush.
Horrible bloody things.

Getting myself a + Car Camera Shop camera I think tomorrow. #bournemouth
Yeah, saw the video. Bournemouth drivers do need a few lessons on why driving fast, on the phone and whilst not paying attention is not good. Everybody seems to be in a rush, like they're important!
Just sent this to head of seafront ops at + Bournemouth Borough Council . Follows a group of employees, about 6 surrounding me and a couple shouting at me to get off my bike at 6:30pm the Thursday before the air show. Took knocking on 8 weeks for Andrew to email me back about it, only after I got in touch to ask what was happening. So, in reply to this: Hello Chris Thanks for your email, and apologies for not getting back to you. I have investigated the situation by speaking to all of my staff potentially involved in the two incidents soon after I received your second email. It would appear that your version of events and my staffs versions are slightly different, and it would appear that both you and my team feel that the other started the situation or made the situation develop in a certain way. Clearly I have a very high expectation on the behaviour and actions of my team at all times, given the high profile of their roles and the huge numbers of visitors that visit Bournemouth Seafront, and given that the vast majority of my staff are employed on a short term seasonal basis we will be taking steps to ensure that our induction, training and management of our seasonal staff next year ensures that everyone is clear on the expectations placed on them. Given that I am going to struggle to unpick the correct version of events from two conflicting versions, I will apologise for any behaviour which you encountered from my staff if it was in fact uncalled for. At the same time I would ask that you respect the cycling byelaw that exists on the seafront to ensure that my team do not need to intervene if they observe that you are cycling in either a no cycling zone or on the promenade between 10am and 6pm in either July or August. If I can be of any further assistance with this please do not hesitate to contact me again. Andrew I wrote this: The simple matter is I was more or less treated with utter contempt by the group of people telling me to get off my bike when they had no right to do so. However stupid and inadequate the cycling facilities are along the seafront I stick by them and hope that someone on the council wakes up and does something about it, the very time that people want to cycle along the seafront, in the summer holidays they can't and as such are left to deal with the terrible quality of driving and roads in the town. I don't expect the staff concerned to come forward and say that they did what they did and it might be worth employing people on a long term basis instead of the likes I came across that day. I did expect more from the chap who seemed to be in charge, I try not to be a cynic when it comes to Bournemouth Council but things like the surf reef, that stupid sign and other things that involve OUR money that the council seems to think belongs to it doesn't help matters and people wearing council uniforms, well half a uniform and sun glasses barking orders at me like some animal won't go far either. I know that you and others put a great deal of effort into the Air Show and it is great to see planes flying over the seafront but I get the impression that employees CVs, the burger van and the council benefits from it, the council more so that money can then be poured in to other ridiculous ideas without giving us, the very people from who you get your money any say. The Nautilus fiasco being one of them. Had you asked me about that or the NCP / Licet idea I would go with that because OUR money is not at risk. A big change is needed at this council, young fresh ideas from people who don't live in Talbot Woods or tow party lines and think that planting a tree is going to help the town. I will certainly not be voting for this council, I think that an independent is needed and then a fully elected Mayor. The Talbot Woods brigade as had its time, they need to be put out to grass. Thank you for finally getting back to me. Chris. #bournemouth
Bloody hell. A case ordered on Saturday still hasn't turned up. Paid for 1st class delivery. This is why I hate the Royal Mail.
It's showing as despatched. Bought it via Amazon. No tracking ref as it is normal post.
Looks like + Clove Technology are coming to the rescue!
Casemate tough. Always had those.
I'll try it out. Could probably live with that, the protection is a big one for me.

Brilliant sound of thugs singing the England national anthem as I turn to ITV 1. No doubt they'll fully pledge their patriotism by swearing at the ref, opposition players and fans. Don't forget smashing a pub up after and fighting in the streets. Bloody football.
When England play Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland they each have their own anthems. They all also have their own anthems when playing other nations even though they are not official. You don't here Scotland fans singing God Save the Queen.
Pretty much close to a crash a day. When will people learn to drive with a gap and not so fast. Being on the phone won't help. #bournemouth
Drink! Thank god for the NHS. Just think if the twat had to pay for his medical attention, there would be uproar.
Everyone is changing their picture to Eric Schmidt on Google+ to protest the expansion of shared endorsements in ads. Well, not everyone. More like virtually no one. But if you did want to protest this way, the rules seem to allow this.
Are these any good? Was going to stick them on eBay but if they are any good I'll keep them.
I'm now a Sony man. I've had lots of phones and tablets in the past but now it looks like I've found my perfect match with + Sony Xperia Both the Z1 and Tablet Z are my devices of choice. Both have that premium feel, they are both close to that pure Android look and feel which is a big thing as is the camera. The heavy skins from some is a real turn off and the Nexus range just felt like it was missing something. If you've got the Z1, get the magnetic charging dock, it'll make charging sooooo much easier.
Here we go. Now the +BBC News is Google bashing, again. Look, it is very simple. If you don't want to be in the new ad thing, just opt out. Why do people have to make such a bloody fuss about these things when it so fucking easy to just decide if you want to be part of it or not. Typical doomers.
It's pathetic that a man who has worked his backside off has to justify his move out of the UK. If anything, Sir Richard should be an inspiration, model of what you'd can achieve. The UK has become so worryingly obsessed with the tax affairs of other people. Goody luck to him, he's earned it. The way this country is headed I'd be right behind him if I could. + Virgin

Anyone in #bournemouth know what has caused part of Heron Court road to be closed off by the police, the Charmimster Road end?

+ Sony Xperia Found it. It's the message alert 2 from the K700i. Made my weekend!
My towel has come to life!
Fellow Xperia Z1 owners. How are you finding the battery? Not a great deal of use, a few calls, bit of Google+ use, few emails and texts with a bit odd browsing today.
In advance, no I didn't watch the football last night and I don't really care who won, scored, got sent off or rolled around on the floor like a little girl. Bloody football.
Just had some fun playing with our new Go Pro camera. Check out our first test video, bringing you a new perspective and insight into the fantastic creatures that live here at the Oceanarium! We look forward to bringing you lots more!!
Rather impressed with my first + Sony Xperia handset. #android #xperiaz1
Got it. Super phone and it's as close to stock Android as I'm going to get without having a Nexus. Camera, screen is super. Liking it so far.
Looks like a keeper. Decent build quality and internals.
+ Rich Fletcher Where do you get the docks from.
Can you guess the oddest object Alan, our expert Dyno Rod engineer, has pulled out of a drain? Find out from the star of our latest TV advert below and follow his top tips to avoid blocked drains and unnecessary call outs.
Walked in to the Three shop twice, nearly walked out with the Xperia Z1
Without root, sounds even more likely I'll be picking one up.
In preparation for my possible purchase, which do I download? UK unbranded or unbranded from xda?
I feel sorry for Scotland. They have a guy, Alex Salmond going through with this for his own ego. I can't understand why he wants to get independence from the UK yet jump in to bed with Europe, Scotland would certainly not be independent. Even so, like NATO he would have to apply. Crazy fool. #scotland #eu
+ Martin ReadingSenór Vape Indeed but that is simply pandering to Nationalists. Each PM has left out the elected reps of each home nation, it would take nothing to have each meet up to go over things, things that have a bearing on all of us. Sadly though, an English Gov would be hijacked by football thugs, imagine the like of the EDL being involved? The only time they are patriotic is at a football match.
She has a brain?
Hour and a half of swimming has made me mega hungry....
This week is looking good. Keep the shorts and flip flops going that little longer. #Bournemouth # Dorset
Can we stop this sentiment on things........
One person takes offence and the police get caught up in time and money.
