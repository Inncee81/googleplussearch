Waste of money you will get more out of reall photography by buying a real camera dslr the romantic feel of the dark room process and film and exciting dslrs out there is being ruined by these trashy ridiculous looking cold war spy camera add ons phones will never have that human interaction in the studio or exciting photo shoot on a Greek island which I have done.its over done to much with these phone add on ridiculous looking contraptions.
P.s.sony should know better than wasting effort on this contraption they have amazing compacts what the heck are you guys timing the cold war is over.holy shite what an ugly thing to do to the photo industry.
Next thing you see on a phone is a kitchen sink ...oh but wait there's more buy it now and get it signed by a pro photographer who's a sell out and actually hates this product but the sound of "kching,kching,kching" hell tell you all sorts of shite and throw in a pair of stake knives as well as the kitchen sink that's attached to the phone with the Hubble telescope looking lens that's also coming to a shop near you ;-) at the special price of $thank you very much sucker and .99cents. enjoy your contraptions. With love from oz ,mrtrik.
