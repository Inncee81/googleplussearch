Is that an Android powered, Sony Xperia Tablet Z before mine eye? Where an iPad would once have been?
Welcome to the Dark Side
Ah but you are so wrong, there always have to be sides. People loose their purpose, identity and sometimes even their senses without know what 'side' they are on seriously though, I still see people who bicker among themselves about Nikon or Canon and then team up to tackle the Sony guys who enters the room. Odd really. But I am glad to say times are changing. Even I am contemplating getting a Mac these days
