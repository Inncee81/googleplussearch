looks like the worst waste of time and money the've come up with...
Would love to buy a #djiinnovations â€Ž and #gopro but sadly, I've spent my money on a new digital mixing console this month... I do plan on getting a quad or hexacopter one day though and will be flying at the nearest part in my area...great place for Arial shots! (Deep cut gardens - NJ)
