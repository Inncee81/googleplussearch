Despite the second gen hardware, I've found the interface consistently less smooth than the older Sony Blu-Ray Google TV. Still, this has more potential for updates and runs circles around the Revue (which I literally smashed to pieces after I got the Sony). Best apps: Google Music, YouTube, Netflix and Amazon VOD. Honerable mention: Airtight, which allows my iOS-packing wife to send stuff (not everything works) to the big screen. Keeps her happy and AppleTV at bay.
I wonder, when GTV updates to Jelly Bean, will Flash still be supported in Chrome?
+ Jamie Yates Thanks for the link. My main GTV is the Sony BD player and the only way to do Amazon VOD is in Chrome. Lose Flash, lose Amazon?
