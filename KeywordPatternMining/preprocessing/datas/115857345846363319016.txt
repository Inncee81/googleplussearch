..they want 139 Euro for windows 8 /full.. so I bought an USB stick and downloaded the preview of 8.1. It worked. Magic. Preview does not really deliver much new experiences.. am I the only one who considers windows 8.1 as a boring update? Debian testing is more exciting! Isn't it..?

The alarm is only canceled when the motor is vibrating.
