Sure does, does it fit in the casing? Great to see Nintendo giving the gamepad a needed boost
Ouya had a grand idea but felt short of the mark. Android games are ment to be mobile. This is the downside of trying to make them big screen experiences. The Shield has the right idea but is too overpriced and needs to be paired with a PC for Stream gaming to work. Android and iOS games are fun but they don't measure up to gaming on the Vita or 3ds IN MY OPINION.
