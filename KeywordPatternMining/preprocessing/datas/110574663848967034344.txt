+ Richard Devine I agree with everything you said. I own a 521 and I like it. Not as much as my HTC One, mind you, but we'd be comparing apples and oranges there. The keyboard is great and email is a lot better on there than on Android IMO. Windows Phone has some wins for sure, and at that price you're right. It's simply unbeatable.
