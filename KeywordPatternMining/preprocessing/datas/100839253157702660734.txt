+ Gordon Laing This is very exciting. Am I getting it right that only the A7r has the low pass filter removed?
Can't wait for the full review. Any ideas if there will be a battery grip?
Thanks for this awesome and detailed review.

Sony Mirrorless Full Frame- The Future or Photography? I love gadgets. So it's no surprise that I make it pretty clear what I'm using, and occasionally, what I find intriguing. About a year and a half ago I bought my first modern digital Interchangeable lens camera and as I detailed here, I chose the Sony NEX system. Sony is a company that has shown a willingness to push the boundaries. Here are some examples: Release of the NEX (First mirrorless APS-C system), RX-1 (First Full Frame fixed lens Mirrorless camera), Focus peaking system, and the Alpha SLT system. They make the sensors used in Nikon's flagship Full frame cameras and the sensor used in the iPhone 5 and 5s. So, with the release and subsequent success of the RX-1 it isn't that much of a surprise that Sony is only a few days from releasing an interchangeable lens Full Frame Mirrorless system. It will use the same lens mount as the NEX system and the first 2 models will carry a center-mounted Electronic Viewfinder. Digicame-info.com posted a couple photos which have been confirmed by Andrea at Sony Alpha Rumors. To my eyes, the camera looks like a hybrid. The body and top controls are like an RX-1, the grip and mount are from the NEX bodies, and the hump on top of the body for the EVF that looks like an old school pentraprism box. There have been quite a few exceptional photographers that have moved to mirrorless systems as their primary kit over the past couple years. Trey Ratcliff recently started using the NEX 7 for his epic landscapes. Zack Arias is a hardcore Fuji X series user. TED photographer Duncan Davidson has been using the RX-1 as his main camera for day-to-day use. Aaron Courter, who is an exceptional Portland based photographer and a long time friend has been incorporating the Fuji X cameras into his personal work, wedding and portrait business with great success. I'm in love with the Sony NEX. I never even considered a DSLR camera because of the size, the weight and what I perceived to be its imminent demise. Up until now, you couldn't really get the same image quality and crazy shallow depth of field from a mirrorless camera, but I think the A7 and A7r will be the start of a large scale move away from large DSLR bodies for most photographers. Sure, there are some times when the larger camera really makes sense. The Mirrored design still allows for faster focusing in sports contexts and there is certainly an expectation in event photography that will take awhile to pass. In addition, the larger bodies do have many features still missing from the new breed of mirrorless cameras and certainly handle big glass much better. This is a moment. It feels like the rise of ultra portable notebooks such as the Macbook Air which have almost negated the need for more powerful desktops for all but the most demanding of users. I believe we are witnessing the birth of the future of photography.
Especially with the new full frame #Sony #A7r coming out. This is an interessting article.

Can someone tell me where the icons are stored? Installed the Green and Black Theme, but I want to change a few icons.
Added photos to SmugMug Cover Photo Contest For November 2013.
Wow, it's already October. You know what that means, right? New wallpaper! October's featured image is Coffee Flat, a wide expansive cactus field in the Superstition Mountain Wilderness, just east of Phoenix, Arizona. This image (printed in metal) can also be seen in person at Bezalel Gallery at their new location on Main Street in Scottsdale. Feel free to click on and share the link since there are 5 sizes to choose from. And of course, enjoy!
Here is a HDR panorama I took in Scotland at the Elie Lighthouse. Let me know what you think. +1 if you like it and feel free to share.

Gently wake up in the morning. This sound promising.
Zodiacal Light with the Milky Way overhead, one of many from three great nights of night sky photography in Queensland and New South Wales a few weeks ago. Full story and more images with details:
Set mobile data based on operator? This I think should be simple. I just have to check the builtin variable %TNET. But I just can't seem to figure out how to display the current value of %TNET. I tried it with the task 'show variable' but Tasker tells me that it doesn't work with builtin variables. How can I see the current value of %TNET?
Great way to create light rays in your image.

Beautiful Scotland Picture by picture, I proceed processing my photos from Scotland. This shot was taken on a beautiful evening at Loch Linnhe (near Fort William), right after the big hike to the highest mountain in Scotland, the Ben Nevis. +1 if you like and feel free to share.
This HDR was taken in St. Andrews during the Ricoh Women's British Open. I'm not a golf guy, so I was more interessted in the landscape. This was shot at the beginning of my Scotland trip. Let me know what you think and feel free to share.
Thank you + Jill Vowels and + Marina Davies I guess it is definitely warmer in NZ. ;) Still processing my almost 7000 photos from my Scotland trip. So the 'typical' Highland photos will come. ;)
Find out which App uses roaming Hi all. I just came back from holidays and noticed, that my carrier charged me every once in a while exactly 30kb of roaming data. I have the option 'data roaming' off in my settings. Is there any way to find out, which app had data access (wifi excluded)?
I guess so, yes. But I haven't send any MMS. I already send them an email, but I was curious if this is somehow possible on Android.
My carrier just informed me, that it could be the 'positioning service'. I used my navigation with offline maps a couple of times, but I thought GPS doesn't cost anything?
It's a carrier in Switzerland. Strangely, I used the navigation every day and only few of these days they charged me roaming costs for 30KB. Is there any app that can give me the extact amount of data used of every app?
I just checked the data consume during that time without wifi data. Apparently the Android OS used just a few bit of data every day. During 20 days that cumulated to 27kb. Does somebody know how I could find out what that was? The roaming option was always off.

Google+ for Android: 5 updates you’ve been asking for Google+ gets better when we build it together, so today's new Android app (v4.1) includes a number of highly-requested improvements. In particular: 1. Account and page switching is a lot easier Just like Gmail for Android, you can now switch between multiple Google+ accounts with a couple of taps (vs. signing out and signing in again). And the Google+ pages you manage are likewise in the app menu at all times. 2. Google Apps for Business features are now fully supported If your Apps administrator has enabled Google+, you can now share content publicly, with your circles, and/or with just the people in your organization. In addition: you’ll know at a glance whether someone’s profile is part of your Apps domain. 3. Google Drive photos & videos are now accessible from Google+ If you're storing photos or videos in Google Drive, you now have the option to view and share them from Google+ (on Android, and the web). Drive photos in particular will get enhanced and awesome’d automatically (see plus.google.com/photos/whatsnew ). 4. Location sharing includes more controls Starting today you can share your pinpoint or city-level location with others (if you want), and you can do so on a circle-by-circle basis. For example: you can share your pinpoint location with family, and your city-level location with co-workers. You can also use circles to filter who appears on your “Locations” map. 5. Messenger is going away, Hangouts is sticking around Now that Hangouts provides messaging and video calls across Android, iOS and the web, we’re removing Messenger from the Google+ mobile apps (first on Android, then on iOS). Later today you'll be able to download all of your Messenger conversations (including text and photos) from Google Takeout. The new Android app includes a handful of other updates (like pull-to-refresh), but we’ll let you discover those on your own It’s rolling out to Google Play over the next few days ( goo.gl/xaxMx ), so give it a try and let us know what you think! #googleplusupdate
Have been to Skyfall today.
Enjoyed an evening at Loch Linnhe (Scotland). This shot was taken with my 50mm lens and 28 shots stitched together to a Panorama, because my wideangle lens is still broken.
Hike to Ben Nevis Been to the Ben Nevis in Scotland yesterday. This photos was taken approximately at 600 meters above see level. The top is at 1344 meters the highest mountain on the British Isles. You cannot see the top because of the clouds. It was raining, windy and freezing cold up there. Down at this level it was quiet the opposite. But we managed to get on top, but saw nothing really. Still worth it. Taken with a 50mm and 87 shots.

Panorama Software Currently processing a few Panoramas. I have to say. I tried several Applications like PTGui, but with the free Microsoft Image Composite Editor (ICE) I managed to get the best results. There aren't many tweaks you can do with it, but still, where PTGui had problems, Microsoft ICE did a good job. Let me know what you think. Which Software do you use?
I'm at the moment near Fort William. I would love to see some Puffins. Does anyone know where I could see one this time around? Maybe on the Isle of Mull?
Thanks + Vicky Hunter Guess I am too late at the moment. But will check out Cana anyways. + Brendan McQuillan Been already to the Ben Nevis and Glen Etive. But I wanted to finally see some Puffins. Thanks anyway. + Andy Stuart Great shot.
Finally, saw a few highland cattle today.
+ Harmon Harris I wondered the same. But I think it smelled me. ;-)

Wanna check out a location before you go to shot? Look at . It helped me alot here in Scotland.
Traveled today to two different places on the Isle of Skye (Scotland). Here is a Panorama of the 'Old Man of Storr or in Gaelic 'Bod an Stòir'. Apparently, according to Wikipedia. the science fiction movie Prometheus had a few scenes at this place. +1 if you like it and feel free to share it.

Finally processing a few pictures from my current Scotland travel. I'm at the moment at the Isle of Skye. Here is a Panorama of Ullapool. I broke my wide angle lens the second day I arrived in Scotland, so this pano was taken with a 50mm lens. Trying to do my best without a wide angle lens, but it's not easy when you're used to it. Let me know what you think. +1 and share if you like it. Many more panos and HDRs to come as soon as I can take some time off during my travel.
