Yej, gleder meg til å sjekke fullversjon Fine poeng om hvorfor man ikke bør gå direkte til facebook.com : "No notifications for chat. No push notifications. No ability to share stuff from other apps to Facebook. Better power management (Facebook website is quite heavy and pings AJAX all the time to give you real-time updates, if you leave it open you will loose some battery life). Suitable for touch, no mouse over events. Ability to snap down to 500px (hopefully they will add 320px for chat) and still have usable app due to responsive layout (possible on web too obviously but not implemented so who cares)."
