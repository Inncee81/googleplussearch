All these comments about "communism" are hilarious. I have friends who are real socialists (mostly from Europe) and they laugh their asses off when some Tea Partier refers to our President that way. Anywhere else in the Western World, Pres. Obama and the current Democratic Party would be considered something between centrists and moderate right-wingers. There is no organized or politically effective left wing in American politics. Words have actual meaning, you know. Some of y'all should consider looking into that...
+ Paul Pennell Yeah, no kidding. I especially like the ad hominem attacks \sarcasm
+ Nathaniel Hourt Dude, the remark about ad hominem attacks was directed at the guy who called Sen. Warren a "whore"...
+ Bill Ramey Nope, criticism of intolerance is not intolerance. In fact, to suggest otherwise is fallacious thinking. Karl Popper, one of the 20th century's greatest philosophers of science, summed it up best: "Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them."
