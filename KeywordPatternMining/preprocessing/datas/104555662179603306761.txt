Apple is going to treat the iPad Mini like it does the MacBook Air. Good hardware, decent screen, and no big threat to the full-sized iPad or MacBook Pro. IMO the iPad Mini screen isn't that bad despite it;s resolution.
LOL. Not shown is the Verizon boot screen....
interesting that a color is mentioned in the URL as well... https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_5_black_16gb
I just bought a 16GB Nexus 4 after the price drop. While I still don't regret it - I needed an upgrade from my previous phone - I am still highly compelled to get the N5 when it comes out.
I've played with both Notes at a Samsung store in a Best Buy recently and the only jank I saw was opening an app or going to the home page in the middle of an animation - particularly if a lot of apps are already loaded into memory. However, usage was fine outside of those semi-rare instances. One interesting thing I noticed for the Note 3 was the burn-in on the screen where the time was displayed. Apparently in demo mode, the digital readout is persistent and is on for days or weeks, and when you open the case cover with the window, and you see the screen, you can see where the pixels have sorta burned in permanent after-images. So my advice - stay away from the floor models if they are offering to sell them.
