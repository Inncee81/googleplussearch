I've checked with burngate farm and they are happy for me to leave my car there for the day. What time shall I meet you all at burngate farm tomorrow morning for the sunrise?
Ps. About to leave Brighton so might not respond until I arrive at about 10pm
Guys, I've arrived far later than planned so a bit difficult to arrange times for the morning. I'm going to go straight to Durdle Door, aiming for about 6.15 to 6.30 at the car park.
Ok, see you in the morning!
Likewise to both of you. I got tied up with my last photo and didn't get to say farewell to many people, but it was nice meeting you all and look forward to seeing you again in the future
