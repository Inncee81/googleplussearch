+ Jody Barnes I almost pulled the trigger on a LG G2 last night... such a sweet phone
+ Jody Barnes $650 would be one of them. lol And with the Nexus 5 in the horizon I might be able to get the same basic phone for half the price. (minus the epic battery). Also, I'm going out of town next week and they didnt have any cases for them. So, not gonna roll for 3 weeks without some kind of protection on that slippery lil bugger.
