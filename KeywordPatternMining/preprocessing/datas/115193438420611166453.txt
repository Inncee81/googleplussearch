1 I like the dial on the front of the body, so this is not 3-navy any more, it is 4-navy, if the back is build like RX1, and this was one of my wishes to my NEX-7 replacement model. 2 But there is no rumor about SSS of something better - this is not good at all. 3 The shooting mode dial can be and can not be IMO, but there is no internal flash - no great possibility to turn flash up like on NEX-7 and no possibility to carry external flash at all. 4 Not very clear, but I feel EVF can't be turned up like on new Lumix G7 - again, not good at all. I probably like EVF at the left corner of the body more (like NEX-7 and 6) and if so, there is hided possibility to turn EVF up.
Michelle, I think it is good to visit Dyxum site Lens reviews at This is an unique database of photographers opinions and you can select lenses you are thinking about. These opinions are free from sellers and producers "alleluia"
One more link Kurt Munger reviews, these Sony and Sigma included. I think trustworthy to read and think through.
