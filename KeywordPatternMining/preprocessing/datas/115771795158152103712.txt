+ Cali Lewis this is great! definitely would be useful for movie lighting.
this is absolutely amazing! there really is no limit to where this can lead.
it was cutting through the cardboard like butter!
you're actually less likely to cut yourself with a sharp knife because it is less likely to slip. if you do cut yourself, it's a cleaner cut, so it's easier to heal.
+ John Pozadzides an anecdote: when i was younger i was cutting something with a serrated knife and i slipped, shaving from my finger a layer skin. that's when my dad told me the sharp-knife fact that i wrote about earlier. the cut was extremely shallow, not reaching raw skin, but for a while i had a bit of 'knifophobia' anyway. i'm still wary of my dad's extra-sharp kitchen knives, despite the fact that they're safer, both for reasons already stated and because they have slip covers.
that's cool, but i think it'd be easier if you just cut out the email step.
