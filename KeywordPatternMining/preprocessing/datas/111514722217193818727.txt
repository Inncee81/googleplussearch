+ Sony Linux Versions of these would be pretty sweet!
+ Je Saist True although any Linux option would please me. Increased Linux adoption is always good and also if it ships with any one Linux distro it will be much easier to use the one of your choice than if it just ships with Windows because drivers and software would be fairly easy to port and adapt if required. Personally I am not a huge KDE fan but one of the best things about Linux is choice so I am not about to criticise anyone for their choice in desktop environment or distro ... well ... unless it tries to copy Mac OSX or Windows! (Sort of) kidding aside, people should be able to choose and use whatever suits them best.
