Totally agree. Importing feeds from Feedly is excellent idea, but setting them up is tedious. I have 50+ feeds but I don't want them all to be on the home screen. I want to select 5-10 and only way to do this now is to deselect other 40. Doing it every time when I change theme is out of the question. (I'll write feature request for improving Feedly feed import - regardless of eventual cross-theme support)
