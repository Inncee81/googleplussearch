Oops, I didn't see this post last night and I just posted the same thing so I'll just jump on this thread + Carlos Mercado . I'm in the same boat, Watchdogs was my only game till 2014. My problem is that I'm not in Ass. Creed and I'm not a fan of BF4 (rather I enjoy Counterstrike). So this leaves me in a tight spot, and I'm currently leaning towards Killzone as I like the futuristic aspect of it. However, I never owned any KZ titles before but I remember playing a killzone for PS2 or PS3 and I something about it did not sit well with me. The movement seemed restrictive (I was used to Halo). I remember for the PS 3 I got the game Resistance:Fall of Man and I loved it...great storyline and fast gameplay. Thoughts?
After watching several videos, I'm going with Killzone. Barring an awful review, it will be first game. Unless of course whatever demo the PS4 comes with can keep me entertained until the next wave of release titles.
Good to know + Nelson Morales , that's actually a pretty spectacular incentive now that I think about it . Maybe CAPCOM should take note.
Agreed. This was one area where for whatever reason it took a while to get released, but looking forward to it.
Looks pretty good. I remember seeing the original multiple times back in the 90's.
