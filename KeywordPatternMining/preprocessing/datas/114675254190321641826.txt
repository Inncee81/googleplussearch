Nice. How's the SM2? I've currently got a Xperia Z, Vita, Sony Surround system and a 32" Bravia. Looking to get the SM2 to compliment my Z and of course I preordered a PS4. I personally love that Sony products just work so well together (my Bravia remote controls both my surround and my old PS3 [RIP])
