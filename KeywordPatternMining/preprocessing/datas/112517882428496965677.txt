I was expecting a brightly colored people giving it all they got kind of sports photo. should have known better. It isn't an old school sports photo at all. A black n white too, good pic.
Thanks peter. I'm saving up for a good camera. Since I stopped working all I want to do is photography. I loved my samsung galaxy's camera. Which of the cell phone cameras would you choose?
