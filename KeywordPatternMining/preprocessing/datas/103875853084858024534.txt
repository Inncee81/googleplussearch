Thought long and hard about this lens. It's a steal for the price and the quality it provides. Heard good things about the Sigma series of M43 lenses. And Blunty's enthusiasm almost pulled me over the line. But I am not sure if I will use it much. So I won't buy it.........yet ;)
Looks like a cross between a Fuji Instax Mini 7 and a Fuji X100 Looking forward to the review.
+ Justin Veldhuizen I agree. + C Rankin is destined to be the star of this challenge
By the way, fair critique of + Blunty - DigiDIRECT on the composition of my photo. Tried to improve it with the crop, as I didn't have the opportunity to do it in cam. Had to sees the moment, so to speak. But a deserved winner and great entries overall!
I also taped over the flash on my Instax Mini, after looking for the off switch which isn't there. But the cam is a fun little toy!
Impressive stuff! I wish I could afford one. A little bit of extra cash would make life so much easier ;)
Thanks for the mention in the vid! My original plan was to take the picture with my mirrored glasses surrounded by mirrors. But I could not find a suitable location. I settled for less, and you shouldn't do that in a challenge ;)
I agree. This group is a great place to be. Love the interaction and the ever increasing quality of pictures!
