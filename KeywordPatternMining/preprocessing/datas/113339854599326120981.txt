It is becoming increasingly difficult to do business with a company that is closed so often.
I could not agree more with statements by Edmund - and I understand that they place their beliefs as a higher priority than business. But I do have a business to run and I do order a lot of gear from B&H - and am currently in a bad situation because I can not track something on back order. I will continue to do business with B&H, but must locate an alternate supplier during the published holiday seasons, as I must meet my commitments to customers and keep my business running.
