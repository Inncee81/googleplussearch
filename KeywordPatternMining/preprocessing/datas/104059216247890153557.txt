Lots of things I like about this shot but that light just in front of the buildings... wow!
Sony looking like they are moving ahead quickly with camera technology. Want!

+ Raúl Mesa Well, I think the point of these cameras is to have something smaller? Personally I'm not that bothered with the extra size/weight but it could be really useful for travel. Would be lovely to have something almost like a compact with FF DSLR quality!
+ Mark Hobson That's good to know. A 5DIII is currently at the top of my wish list. This one would be great as a second/travel camera - although probably excessive/unaffordable to have both
A Taste of Heaven. A departure from the classic rolling hills of Tuscany, on advice from a friend and local mountain guide, I went on a day trip to the Apennine mountains near Gualdo Tadino in Umbria. After what had seemed a frustrating week searching for views on the difficult Tuscan roads, this was arguably the best day of my time in Italy. Although I managed to get a few good shots of rural Tuscany in the end, I’ve always favoured mountain environments for landscape photography so this was a welcome trip. We drove for over an hour, scaling the heights into the cooler air and risking a puncture on the rough rock-strewn surface. As we ascended, the sun got lower and the cloud cover began to part. To the great patience of my mountain guide, I kept yelling ‘stop’ whenever the view seemed right. This particular shot screamed out at me as soon as we reached the top of the highest mountain, Monte Serra Santa, where there is a chapel at the end of the road. The clouds had formed the perfect shape and let the sun spill its rays on to the land below. It was a moment where everything had come together, to give me a brief taste of heaven. No wonder they built a church there. #hdr #hdrphotography #landscapephotography #hdrlandscapes #photomatix #nikcolorefexpro4 #photoshop #travelphotography #roadphotography #churchphotography #heaven #heavenonearth #magnificentscenery #italy #italia
Many thanks + Robert Glöckner and + Constantin Simionica !
+ Gert Wallis Yeah me too. My best shots came when I got out and walked for a bit. Problem is you can't always tell if walking a certain way is worth it until you get there!
Apologies for my attempt at poetry! I was just trying to come up with words that fit the image... The Good Life. What is a good life? Is it making money, buying all the things we need? Is it following our dreams, becoming all we want to be? Or is it much simpler? Being with those who make us happy. Maybe it’s growing grapes in Tuscany. Is it an illusion, just a dream? Is a good life only what we wish it to be? I think it is looking around and inside, and appreciating what we see. But also it is this: In the short time we have, whatever challenges there may be, choose a good life, and make it reality.

Thanks for all the lovely comments It was pretty much my first attempt at poetry, certainly the first time I've posted publicly with an image. Perhaps I'll try again another time
Actually + Shari Shepard there has been a terrible mistake! You should have been able to download it for personal use for free - for some reason it added $0.99 onto my base price. I can't see how I can refund you through Smugmug, as technically they have sent you the image and you can't return it. Instead, please let me send you a free 5x7 or 5x10 print of your choice. Just let me know which one and I will order it for you
+ Shari Shepard Here is my gallery to choose from: Hope this is ok!
Haha, thanks + Mark Hobson - I've received a few comments about Gladiator now!

Time to Make Hay. I took this shot on the only time I managed to drag myself out at dawn during my trip to Italy. After snoozing for half an hour I was running out of the pre-dawn light. I shoved some clothes on and some cereal in my sports beaker for breakfast on the road. Unsure of exactly where to go and not helped by the malfunctioning satnav app on my phone, I jumped in the car and headed for higher ground. Panicking, I raced along the winding Tuscany lanes and took risks cutting corners, one eye on the road, the other 360° around for potential views. All the while shaking off the dream state I was still half in. I desperately needed food and coffee. There was no time, the pink in the sky would fade in minutes and the great ball of nuclear energy would light up the world. I almost skidded to a stop when I saw the bale of hay, behind it the first fingers of light reaching up from the horizon. It was now or never. If I drove any further to look for something better the colour in the sky would disappear and I should have stayed in bed. A brief check list in my mind; camera, lens, tripod, base plate, lens blower and cloth… and something else! Hurry… think… oh yeah, remote release. Wake up! Forgetting that now could cost me a few vital minutes. I extended the tripod legs as I strode to the spot just in time to set it as I arrived. A quick three shot burst to check exposure. A rapid adjustment then immediately another burst which became this HDR shot. Five minutes later the sun revealed its full glory and threw out its usual colourless rays, quickly turning the sky pale blue. The lesson; make hay before the sun shines. #hdr #hdrphotography #hdrtheworld #hdrphoto #hdrlandscapes #landscapephotography #sunrisephotography #dawnphotography #pinksky #toscana #italia #tuscany #italy #tuscanyvacation #italytravel #italyphotography #autumncolors #autumnphotography #fall #fallcolors

Road to Rome. No, this road doesn’t actually lead to Rome. I have no idea where it goes. This is the furthest along I got. In some of the comments on my last Tuscany landscape, Road to Val d’Orcia (a theme seems to be emerging here) – there were a few mentions of the film Gladiator with regards to the Tuscan scenery. Inspired by these comments, and being a huge fan of Hans Zimmer, I edited this image to the majestic and stirring soundtrack to the film. I imagined my name was Maximus Decimus Meridius and was marching on this road to Rome. Although the buildings that I decided not to Photoshop out slightly burst that bubble. That and the fact that I’ve never really seen myself as a Russell Crowe type. Although sometimes I fancy myself as a general with an army at my command I’m not even sure that the colours in this shot are anything like the look of the film. I shall watch it again to see. I’d also imagine that it would be a bloody long walk to Rome from here. But hey, one can dream ;-) #hdr #hdrphotography #hdrlandscapes #landscapephotography #landscapephoto #tuscany #italyphotography #gladiator #roadphotography
+ constantin simionica Excellent, then I have achieved my goal! Thank you
+ Tack Soon Thanks! You'll have a great time there, lovely place
Have to share this here: Kind of opposite colours but isn't it uncanny how the road, landscape and light looks! I had no idea until after I edited this shot the similarities. Of course it was blue in the film to represent tragedy.
Thank you + Shari Shepard for your wonderful compliments Of course you are welcome to have a print of this as offered. Shall I send it to the address you gave to Smugmug? Would you like glossy, lustre or metallic?
The Small Things. It was one of those moments that you occasionally experience with photography. When you take a breath and let it out slowly, and extend the reach of your senses. Observation levels sharpened, switched on for the hunt. Seeing through the angles, from macro to zoom. Sometimes compositions stand out when looking far towards the horizon. Other times, the tiny splash of a contrasting flower against a uniform background. From an insect buzzing past your ear to the hiss of long grass in the valley. It can involve sitting for an hour, watching the light change. Or the briefest of moments challenging the speed of split second reflexes. Subtle gradients of light and strong dark lines. From looking out into the vastness of this great planet, to noticing the small things in front of your next step, photography enhances our ability to see true beauty. I recommend it to everyone. #nature #naturephotography #naturephoto #autumn #fall #fallcolors #fall2013 #tuscany #italy
+ Thomas Gillingham + Eric Tang + Mark Hobson Thanks very much! I started taking up writing before pursuing photography more seriously. I'm just starting to combine the two so it's very encouraging to hear that!
The power of Flickr Explore. Smashed 50,000 then 100,000 views in 24 hours! G+ is still my favourite place for image sharing though ;-)
+ Mark Hobson I personally would recommend getting your photography out there where-ever possible. At the same time, it is better to concentrate on the ones that you feel most comfortable with than spread yourself too thin. Up until I started hitting Flickr Explore recently I was getting most of my views here, anywhere between 1000-5000 views per image, depending on how lucky I got and how widely I shared it to communities. But if and when you do hit Flickr Explore (been on there only a few times in the last 8 months), if you get near the top then recently I've been getting about 50,000 views per day. It's a wave that can only produce enough surf to ride for so long though ;-) G+ is more consistent. And there's a bit of a knack to figuring out what the Explore algorithm likes too... I can give tips if you like.
The Beautiful One. One minute, I was walking along searching for stunning scenery. Then the next, she drifted past me, immediately catching my attention with her startling beauty. I could not take my eyes off her, for fear of letting her drift away, out of my reach. I watched her fly gracefully, unfazed by the strong winds attempting to blow her off course. To my disbelief, she landed right in front of me, as if to invite my gaze. There she sat, on the end of a long stem of flowering grass, waiting for me. I focussed on her intensely, desperately hoping to get the shot. The attention of a butterfly can only last so long. Moving as fast as I could, I tried to capture her magnificence as she posed willingly, before she could lose interest and fly away. As she sailed around in the breeze, focussing on her became difficult. I was running out of time. She displayed great patience that I was not expecting. Long enough to get this shot, which was the last I took of her. In the end, she stayed sitting on the end of the wavering grass. It was I who left her there, basking in the sunshine. The golden light falling on the most beautiful insect I have ever seen. #natureartthursday #naturephotography #nature #macrophotography #macro #insectphotography #butterfly #butterflyphotography #goldenlight #beauty
Thank you + Mark Hobson , very kind words mate. To be honest, I was drawing on inspiration of something else, there's more beneath the surface of this story ;-)

For more info on the tech behind the shot, I've just written a blog post Another thing, which I can't quite believe, is that it has just reached no.2 on Flickr Explore!

Google+ Surpasses 1 Billion Users! Look out Facebook, here we come! Yesterday it was revealed that Google+ has quietly surpassed the 1 Billion user mark. This is very exciting news-- how could I not create an #infographic for that? I also shared my thoughts on the numbers here: These numbers only represent the number of registered users, as opposed to the number of active users. While the real test of a successful social network is in it's active user numbers, the registered user numbers are nothing to take lightly. What are your thoughts on this new data? #socialmedia #evang+ #googleplus #twitter #instagram #pinterest
Red Sky 24 hours on from my last shot and I found myself drawn to the same hay field. The scene that greeted me was even more spectacular than the night before. The sun, which had disappeared more than half an hour ago, was still colouring the high level cirrus with pink/red hues whilst the low level clouds had turned a forbidding grey. Unfortunately, all the hay rolls had gone, (carted off by the farmer), but the evening light show more than made up for their loss. Here's a 'brief' précis of my workflow for this shot:- Convert raw brackets to tiffs in adobe camera raw & deal with any chromatic aberrations. Save and load into Photoshop and treat with Topaz De-noise. This can take some time as each bracket usually requires a different amount of noise reduction but it ultimately leads to a cleaner final image. Save & load brackets into Photomatix to produce the usual tonemapped image. Save & reload into Photoshop and run through Topaz Clarity for contrast and colour adjustments. I then globally or selectively apply the usual Photoshop tools i.e. levels, exposure, hue/saturation etc using layers until I'm happy with what I see. I took the sky through another round of de-noise on this shot and then applied selective sharpening using the high pass filter. Voila. Some would say this is over the top but I enjoy it. This tripod mounted hdr started out with 9 exposures -4 to +4 but I ditched the two brightest brackets as they were blowing out the subtle light in the sky. Nikon D700 & 16-35 VR f4 at 16mm. ISO 200, f18, 1/25 - 2.5 sec's. #sunset #sunsetphotography #redsky #redskyatnight #hdr #countryside #countrysidephotograpy #sky #clouds #twilight #hayfields #hay #kent #fields #harvest #longexposure
Looking for a view of the sunset near my host’s house just outside of Perugia, I discovered this small vineyard overgrown with wildflowers. I then walked back to the house after watching bats hunt insects in the dimming dusk light. Tech info:

+ Robert Glöckner Thanks The beers seemed twice as strong as usual from the lack of sleep! Yeah, the Italian church interiors do have quite an atmosphere to them, albeit pretty dimly lit - more so than it seems here. I've found Glamour Glow to be really helpful in recreating that atmosphere.

The main square in Perugia, the Piazza IV Novembre. I probably spent too much time editing this one, see tech info:
+ Robert Glöckner Thanks After being awake for 36 hours and drinking plenty of beer, by the time it got dark I was already crashing out on the bed at my host's home! I will have to return and experience the night-life sometime.

+ Mark Hobson That's a huge compliment coming from you, cheers mate!
2nd shot from Perugia, inside the Palazzo dei Priori:
I looked at it in the frame, and the gap was quite large. I decided the seats were more interesting than the floor as a leading foreground instead, and they fit the frame perfectly
Thanks Also by this position I could get more of the windows and the light they gave. Must admit, I didn't put a lot of thought into it at the time - just went with instinct. I was too tired to think, had no sleep the night before because of a very early flight!
Thanks very much + Paul Lamoureux - it's good to go with the gut when taking pictures, I find being improvisational is more creative
Thanks + Kevin Perkins - it is an interesting and curious contrast between the two! Modern v ancient.
+ Mark Harrison Wow that's a huge compliment - thanks very much!
My week in Tuscany has come to an end. Beautiful place although getting good landscape shots has been occasionally challenging. Looking forward to editing them when I get back.
It's about time I got started on this whole circle sharing business, and what better way to start than by picking my favourite members of the community HDR Landscapes https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/105201264249647234606 that I own and moderate. These excellent photographers are regular contributors and deserve adding to your circles if you have any interest in HDR or landscape photography. Apologies to anyone in the community that I may have missed. I'll be updating and sharing this circle every couple of months - please share your best HDR landscape photos to the community in that time to be included. Many thanks to all members who provide great feedback and encouragement for all who post, and thanks most of all to the members who post their beautiful pictures - it is a pleasure and an honour to run such a great friendly community! Thanks also to the moderators + Robert Glöckner and + constantin simionica who do an excellent job of keeping things run smoothly as well as making their own photo contributions. Please reshare this circle and invite your circles to join the community. As founding members at an exciting time that G+ is rapidly growing we can be a part of something great together!

Anyone know a good single trip camera travel insurance company that covers professional gear, preferably UK based? #camerainsurance #travelinsurance #insurance
My last policy ran out and I wanted to find someone cheaper. Was hoping to get a single trip deal but it looks like I have to go for a yearly contract and get travel insurance separately. Found a good deal so far but it has yet to be agreed.
The HDR Landscapes September Competition is now live! The winner has their image as the community profile image throughout the month of September, with credit in the About section. The top five runners up with the most +1s will be invited to be displayed in the Hall of Fame section, along with the winner. RULES One shot per entrant. Additional images after your first entry will be removed. The theme this month is seascapes - so your shot must include water. Don't worry if you can't get to the coast, as lakes and rivers are also allowed. The main thing is water must feature prominently in the composition of your image. Your image must have been edited using HDR tonemapping software, whether from multiple exposures or a single image. You must state which software you used. You can do this in the comments if you forget in the description. This competition will be open to the public for viewing but it will be set up as a private event to disable resharing, to make voting fair. If this does not prevent resharing, then I reserve the right to judge the winner. The runners up will still be decided by +1s in this circumstance. Please join the community HDR Landscapes https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/105201264249647234606 if you haven't already to enter the competition - it is open to everyone. Please +1 on your favourite entries, and comment on any you like! Good luck!

Keep posted on community updates for the next competition theme!
A late sunset at Hole In The Wall Beach.. Another quite night along Hole in the Wall Beach. Headphones on and the calmness of my surroundings makes for a great night. Sometimes walking back to my car with very little light is quite eerie as you are the only one left on this vast beach.
Been a bit quiet here over the last week frantically preparing for a last minute trip to Tuscany. Expect a flood of classic Italian landscape images in a couple of weeks time when I'm back!

Cool image courtesy of showing the growth of Shanghai from 1987 to 2013. I like how the photographer took the image at the exact same time as the original - check out the clock.
It's interesting how size matters. When I was creating this HDR photograph on my 27 inch iMac, it looked really great. Just now, when posting it here on G+ the thumbnail that I'm looking at appears so drab and lifeless. Because of this I know that many people will scroll right past it without clicking to enlarge it to full screen where it looks totally different. This is something I learned decades ago shooting and printing black & white landscapes. There are some photographs that are like little jewels and look best displayed as such in a smaller size to preserve their fragility. Not so for grand vista landscapes. These dogs need to be printed and viewed large to let their grandeur shine. Knowing this, whenever I encounter a landscape online that doesn't look great, I'll give it a chance full screen before moving on. In most cases the look totally changes and I get what the photographer was feeling when creating the piece. Happy Friday! ~Captain Photo ps: The story of this shot is on my blog.
+ Raúl Mesa Well, I think the point of these cameras is to have something smaller? Personally I'm not that bothered with the extra size/weight but it could be really useful for travel. Would be lovely to have something almost like a compact with FF DSLR quality!
+ Mark Hobson That's good to know. A 5DIII is currently at the top of my wish list. This one would be great as a second/travel camera - although probably excessive/unaffordable to have both
