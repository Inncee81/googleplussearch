These 4 I MOST identify with: 5. THEY WILL BREAK THE LAW Trespassing into abandoned buildings has always been a favorite activity among photographers, and they rarely even concern themselves with the fact that they are breaking laws. 10. ENVY TAKES A NEW FORM Among men, there is the well-known term penis envy. Among photographers, it’s a whole different thing. It’s called camera envy. 30. YOU’LL HAVE A HARD TIME PROVING THAT YOU WERE TOGETHER ON VACATION That’s because they’ll be taking most of the pictures, without themselves being in front of the camera. 31. THEY WON’T PHOTOGRAPH WHAT YOU ASK THEM Think having a photographer partner will bring you advantages? Think again. Photographers are very proud and stubborn creatures and they will rarely photograph anything they consider unworthy, unless it’s paid or they like it. Thanks for laugh!
