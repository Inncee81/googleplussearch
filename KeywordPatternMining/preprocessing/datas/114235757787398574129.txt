I got the photo that the link catcher is showing in the post. I don't think so.. and most of the people are now moving towards g+ now. I told my friends to try g+ and now all are highly addicted to it. So i have alone migrated nearly 300 people. And their are many people like me
It has tight integration with every google service (nearly) +1's and everything. Most awesome android social netwoking app. Works flawlessly on any phone where as facebook's android app sucks on most phones. Orgzanized things like the categories in community. And at last some good people who want to keep it clean by reporting everything wrong
There is a video of nokia concept phone 'nokia 888' anyone watched it
+ Fredrik Marklund you are saying smartwatches and glasses can never become a hit. And also saying that smartphones era is coming to end. So are you trying to say that we are going in stone age(once again)
Batteries has not seen a development in the last 8-10 years. And i think samsung can use the piezo electricity generators instead of a battery. It generates power on board and smartwatches don't need enough power so they can plant 1-2 generators in each watch. It would be awesome and as it generates electricity by movement. So their will be no shortage too.
Too odd.. watching any video on it will look alike watching a video with fisheye effect applied
If i'll be giving it a award then i will be giving it most silly design till now
Too prone to damage.. and i would never want to see my ₹44000 phone divide into two halves just because of a little mistake.. too odd.... i will never buy a flagship device like that.. + Richard Johansson okk its screen is not glass.. but the whole body except it is hard.. remember this is not a flexible phone this is a curved phone!!!
Steve jobs has some rules for the size of phones and tablets... tablets should not be smaller than 9.7 inch because it worsens the experience of a tablet and phone should not be greater than ( i don't remember the size) and tim cook has made a mess with both of them.. and he doesn't have the imagination steve jobs had.. maybe this is the reason apple is sinkin slowly
+ Stefan Svartling oops!! I forgetted the size of both..actually readed about this thing in his biography... long time ago... :-)d
