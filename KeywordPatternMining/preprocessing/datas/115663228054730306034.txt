After 6 LONG Years WAITING, at last Sony produced a smaller Full Frame camera under the name Alpha A7 & Alpha A7R with small body and small hand grip. During this long period, all of time I was waiting for this day. I remember I met Eric Billette , the Sony Europe representative at 'Focus on Imaging 2009' in NEC Birmingham and told about my concern. Later on I met DIME VIP People at Sony World Photography Awards gala on 19th January 2010 and again I told them about my disappointment. Now, Sony produced Alpha A7 & Alpha A7R which I am going to hold them at last. During this long period, I was using my dear girlfriend Minolta Dynax 7 as well my other mistress, a Pentax compact digital camera for my observation of my surroundings.
