Pretty much the same, Google+ and Reddit are my social media of choice. They provide information, entertainment and food for thought. Google+ for mostly original content and Reddit as aggregator of other sites. Next, very far, come Twitter and Pinterest. Facebook and Linkedin are anecdotal and the rest I don't even know they exist...
