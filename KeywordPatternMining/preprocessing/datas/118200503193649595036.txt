That's whats up! This might be my next tablet, if I dont cop the Asus Nexus 10
I suspect this is will be on comparable to the Nexus 10 pricing and being a close 9in tablet I can overlook its pricing. I have a Best Buy gift card too that I was saving for either a new Chromebook or i5 PC...might throw it in this direction.
Pricing like a vet? So says the first gen Nexus 10 owner when it was 399...
I hear where you're coming from + Nicolas Sincere but I have to agree with + Jonathan Franklin . You can never predict device support of the developer community, for example great if you have a Note 3 but I'm still waiting for the G2 right now. Dont have those problems with the Nexus and to a less extent the GPE devices.
I hope not, Im already having issues of relevancy between the Moto X with its two or three features over stock Android (AOSP & Nexus) .
+ Adrian Neal You're right, but I think its going to be a valid question in the future. Everyone is asking LG to better differentiate itself from Samsung, right?
Nexus 7 is a "God" tablet, you cant go wrong with it. After getting the Nexus 7, I did have a desire to get a larger tablet for the home, however for the price of the Nexus 10 I instead purchased both a Samsung 3 Chromebook and Asus Transformer TF101 plus Keyboard Dock. When the Nexus 7 was my daily driver, I had no complaints with it as I wasnt somethng small, mobile and inconspicuous however when started going back to school I moved over to the TF101 and Chromebook. The Nexus 7 is a great tablet but think I'm just over "straight tablets" right now.
