+ Aref Safari Yep, because your low cost hardware wasn't totally driven by Microsoft opening up the PC market to the masses. You can certainly thank Apple and IBM for driving down the cost of that machine you are running linux on. Just because you have the ability to comment does not mean that you should.
Well + kienan vella , if you are referring to me then the answer is no, I do not make that claim. I was in the BBS scene for years before the Internet as we know it started coming about and Mosaic was the only browser. I miss my SPARC some days. Anyway, you fall under the same "just because you can" type of comment." Microsoft did drive down the cost of PC components by making a simple. OS that was easier for the masses to use and allowing any hardware vendor to play. They used some shady tactics to convince/strong-arm the OEMs at points but the end result is that the commodity PC hardware market is a direct result of Microsoft's pushing the OS. The majority of linux users should just thank Microsoft and go on about their days using an OS that is more tuned to their individual needs than a mass-market OS.
I love how dramatic Softpedia makes their headlines..."Microsoft to kill product X on date Y!" It isn't like Microsoft publishes these dates when the software launches because it has a planned lifetime of support or anything. Five years mainstream support, five years sustaining. That totally is not their stated software model and what they have been doing for every OS (except for XP) since windows NT 4.0.
+ Paul Dail How quickly should Microsoft release a new OS that people will not move to, in mass? Three years is a good cycle for hardware.
...think of how long it would take a RAID array to rebuild with a disk that size.
