....or we could legalize marijuana(tax the hell out of it) and implement a sole sales tax throughout. That way there would be no tax cuts and also illegals would be paying taxes as well ...just my opinion, agree or not agree, whatever
...oh and the marijuana thing would save a lot of money in our prison system as well
+ Daniel Salazar whoever said you couldn't grow and smoke it yourself ...currently you can brew your own beer if you want, marijuana shouldn't be any different Some people might prefer to buy it rather than grow it, because they want to be more discreet ...whether it is legal or not, doesn't make it socially acceptable
Correction on my part + Daniel Salazar I couldnt exactly tell if you were arguing with me, but what I meant to say was that if it is legalized and taxed, there is nothing preventing you from growing it on your own...but then like I said in the rest of my comment, some people want to be discreet about it and they might not feel comfortable growing it on their own
+ Daniel Salazar I am not going to extend the marijuana conversation anymore. I will say for the most part I agree with you that we need to stop pointing the finger. And I agree with you that we need to keep the government more accountable of how our money is spent.>>>>Did you know that they wasted $50 million in taxes printing the new $100 bills, because they ink was off and they had to dispose of them and print new ones...to me that is inexcusable. Anyway, I hate to start a fire storm of arguments on this post, but a graduated income tax(what we have now) is not a Democratic principle. Exactly why I believe this country should run off of a sales tax(Yes Europe, i think the UK specifically, has problems with it, but the problems have been pointed out and can be fixed) that way everyone is paying their "fair share" and as I stated before, there would be no tax cut/subsidies, and EVERYONE in this country would be paying the tax
+ Jeff Motter for one, I am not a pot head ...and for two, if you read my post, I am disagreeing with what Elizabeth Warren and Obama believe is "fair"
