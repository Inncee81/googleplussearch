Looking forward to reading your full review.
Yeah I was hoping they'd bring out an improved version of the NEX7; I like the idea of the smaller lenses but still a lot of capacity for capturing detail with a 24mp APS-C.
+ Gordon Laing Hope so; I like the look of the new camera, but one of the reasons I'm interested in the whole system is in order to have something fairly compact that still has great capability - so the 'big' lenses for the A7 are putting me off a bit. Also, I could get a NEX 7 and collect some decent lenses then upgrade to the A7 in a year or so - if those lenses work well. I'm not so interested in pixel count; around 16 to 18 is fine for me.
I was seriously thinking of getting one of these - now I just need to see the definite prices! As usual, the UK price will be much higher than the US equivalent....
+ Richard Sibley Thanks... good old UK prices. I think collecting the lenses might be the really expensive part... Having something potentially this good in a fairly portable package is what really appeals so hopefully the reviews will show that it's worth the money (and the wait).
+ Erkki Juurus I think it's really interesting and I appreciate your thoughts on all this. I've been contemplating the NEX7 for a while (I have a K5 DSLR and a Canon S100) because I want something versatile and reasonably portable - and impressed with what Trey Ratcliffe does with his. Although my DSLR isn't a monster, and it's robust and weatherproof, it's still a bit heavy to lug around so something with decent lens qualities and manual controls of a smaller size really appeals - I would just take it everywhere! This has been much on my mind this year because I'm doing my first 365... anyway, the NEX7 is looking like good value now (although decent lenses are expensive).
+ Erkki Juurus Cool, thanks. Yes, I thought maybe go the NEX7 route (as it's tried and tested, albeit with limitations) and wait to see what great stuff comes out in the next year or two. As for the K5, yes it is a brilliant camera for the money, and suits me as I carry it by bicycle quite often and out in bad weather. The only thing that really lets it down is the autofocus,which is improved on the ii/iiS. I haven't had a chance yet to look at the various articles and videos on the A7/7r, but thanks for that tip. So you think using my Pentax lenses would be good with the NEX and/or A7s? That would be good as I have 3 prime lenses which were about £400 each.
