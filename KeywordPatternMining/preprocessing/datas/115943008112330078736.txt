Looks like the old good #Sony is back. It's innovative again and seems to well understand the essential role of innovations in today's market - unlike #Apple . #Smartwatch
Even #Nike and #Adidas are now in the #smartwatch market. Where is #Apple ?

Don't invent "magic wands" - they too much resemble "magic" styluses that made the first gen of #smartphones nearly unusable. #VRglasses #glasses
There are a lot of good advices for #Apple , but in fact, the best one would be to continue its innovations #SteveJobs started. Apple should open new market ASAP, otherwise even its enourmous cash reserves will vaporize.
Nearly all devices are capable of gesture control, but it doesn’t mean that the technology should really be implemented to them
Smoke detectors is just another example of connected consumer electronic devices that make our lives easier, and in this case also safer. Gesture control will indeed not survive in these devices, but wifi connectivity is the right think as it makes installation easier and cheaper and allows for much smarter cloud based control systems.
#Smartwatch for #kids - excellent idea with good functionality mix, ready to open brand new market segment . If #FiLIP continues with these right choices, it may become the next #Apple .
At a time when people forget where they left their remote control, #gesturerecognition be very useful. And #Google has specifically big potential here thanks to its #Android
Western Digital's My Cloud is a good example of smart marketing riding on the #cloud wave. Will "My Cloud" buzzword even replace "personal storage" one day? - #WD #MyCloud
#FreedomPop is a nice demonstration of decreasing prices in #telco due to increased #VoIP availability that cannibalizes traditional voice services -
#Intel has only 6 percent share in #tablets , and less than 1 percent in #smartphones processors. Intel thus has to try risky strategy of producing its own end user products and creating own markets. The same strategy that cost its long-term ally #Microsoft one billion for its failed #SurfaceRT tablet.
Changing standard is always very difficult, if at all possible. #Valve is too small to succeed; other much bigger players tried and failed to incorporate their #gaming controls.
#Smartphone market is crowded, so vendors are desperately looking for differentiation. #Curved glass displays, or even #foldable #displays are natural innovation. #Samsung is well positioned to open up this segment.
After Tesco milk and Tesco butter, #Tesco #tablet comes - even computers are now labelled much like mayonnaise, noodles, or rice. #Hudl
#Blackberry is forced to dramatic cost cutting, which however further undermines its ability to innovate, and is thus unable to really save it. The result of this strategy may be only delaying the end. This is similar to #Nokia situation back in 2011.
Who knows? Maybe in the future students will learn universal language of gestures instead of writing. If there is one single area that will develop into a huge market, it is definitely gesture control. , #HP , #LeapMotion
#Offline functionality is essential for convenient daily usage of #cloud services; cloud will not get mass adoption without ability to work regardless of connectivity status. #Google is aware of it, but still has long way to go...
The problem with acquisition of any high tech company is that its biggest value are people, who can walk out and even form viable competitors. #Nokia is a big lesson for #Microsoft in this respect. #Jolla , #Newkia , #Sailfish , #Android #WindowsPhone
It looks like #Samsung took from #Apple not only its innovation leadership, but also its strategy of continuous upgrades to stay on top of newly created segment - #Smartwatches
The market of #SmartTV is going to disappear before it fully launched. And so it should be. All efforts to remake TV sets to some sort of giant tablets are meaningless because they are impractical for the end user. #Sony #Bravia #SmartStick #Google #Chromecast
Details are being regularly updated, but the #PC era is definitely over. Welcome in the era of consumer electronics and #cloud services! #SaaS #Tablets #Smartphones #SmartTV
#Apple is turning from leader to follower. No big innovation of #iPhone and no announcement of any new products. Competitors can celebrate.
Bone conduction technology clearly didn’t show all its capabilities yet. And it is ideal for our permanent connection using voice input, while maintaining regular function of our ears. #Disney
By expanding #XboxMusic to #Android , #Apple Devices, #Microsoft is admitting defeat on the mobile OS market, where it has just 3.3% market share after 23 years of development
We will soon see new entertainment formats that will merge television, video, internet and live multiplayer gaming to entirely new services that will be great not only for killing time, but also for education. #Nintendo #Atari #Gaming
Nobody, not even #Apple , has a monopoly on innovation these days. If Apple does not innovate, someone else will do - for example, this Chinese company #Xiaomi . #SmartTV
Welcome to the world with #Smartwatches . This time, #Apple has no credit for this invention and, even worse, changed from the leader to follower. #Samsung #GalaxyGear
The Microsoft/Nokia #partnership from Feb 2011 went wrong: in 2011, #Nokia was still the No.1 phonemaker; now it is loosing over € 1bn a year. What can #Microsoft do differently this time?
#Smartwatch market promisses to be even more dynamic than the #smartphone and #tablet markets. With #Samsung , #Google and #Apple in the game, the starting line is filled with strong favorites that will ensure customers' attention and rapid growth of this segment.
#Nokia strategy to penetrate car #maps market is good, but its implementation will be extremely challenging. Even #Apple failed in competition against #Google .
#3D calls will not save #Skype , because #Facebook #VoIP can reach four times more active users - and this is what really matters. Bad luck for #Microsoft and its $ 8.5 billion investment in Skype.
#Shopify Point of Sale System built on #iPads nicely illustrates how expensive proprietary systems are being replaced by affordable #SaaS services that use general consumer electronics
#Samsung ’s #smartwatch will be unveiled next week. #Apple was unable to come up with any new product - smartwatch or #SmartTV since the death of #SteveJobs in 2011. Apple is thus departing its unique innovation path which catapulted it to its current position of world’s largest IT company. In short: Apple is hesitating, while others act.
The future of car transportation starts to unfold right these days. The first affected markets by #driverless cars will be taxis and logistic firms, but personal cars will soon follow, and so will follow a dramatic change in concept of car ownership that will free up our streets.
While industrial revolution allowed to produce cheaply en masse, #3Dprinting will finally free us from dependence on massively produced copies and will return the individuality to the life of everyone. It was only a matter of time when #3DScanners enter the market. #Makerbot
Designers of #smartwatches should keep in mind that less is more, and that wrist devices should be as light and easy to use as possible. People around #Omate #Truesmart will learn it the hard way. Water resistance is a useful feature, but the camera will make the clock larger and heavier, will make the battery life even shorter, and - last but not least - wrist is not ergonomic for taking pictures.
In the future we will have lots of gadgets, and these will indeed specialize. Camera is an important functionality, but the best place for it is in smartphone, in glasses, or in other items that can easily focus somewhere. In every moment we will carry several devices with us; therefore, it is neither necessary nor appropriate that each unit should have all the features.
I fully agree, This is usefull and appropriate functionality. My point was that devices should specialize, so for example smartwatches should not automatically copy smartphones - purpose of these devices is different.
Will #Google #Helpouts transform employment industry and positively influence lives of many people, or will they become another frustration like #Knol ?
It looks that we will be soon able to use #cloud services even in the clouds - and maybe airlines own entertainment systems will become obsolete sooner than we think.
