Sony's PS 4 Hits Right Price Point, But Undercutting Xbox is Only Half of the Story Great data on inflation-adjusted prices for game consoles. Turns out that the classic 1970s Atari 2600 was the priciest of all, with the PS3 in second place. The $300 PS4 repositions Sony for deeper market penetration for its game titles. While that undercuts Microsoft Xboxes, the elephant in the room is Android-based game consoles expected later this year. Nicking Microsoft is only half of Sony's objective; slowing down Android's march is the other...
ALL! I ran across this posting via Mr. . A great and very informative read, bordering, on a sort of, release. I don't know where the rest of you stand on this issue, , BUT me and my house DO NOT approve or condone this. A question, I often ask people of concern IS: What ever happened to good ole fashion police work? I center that question around the story of the life and time of a cousin of mine, William 'Butch' Childers, who recently retired after nearly forty years of dedicated service to the Dallas (TX.) Metro Police Department (Chief of Detectives, Homicide Division) Butch was, is and always will be a cops cop! He was a genuine hero in the Vietnam War, nearly got the Congressional Medal of Honor, but instead got the Purple Heart, Bronze Star with Clusters, and a battle field promotion. Went on to serve as a military attache in the US DOD, and then became a beat cop for Dallas Metro.Working nights and weekends/grave yard shift, etc. Working his way up through the rank and file and retiring recently having never once having to discharge or even un-holster his weapon. Butch commanded and controlled respect, called for it in word, deed and action, and got it. I say all that to say this, and this is not because he is my cousin, but because if Butch thought for one single solitary moment that he couldn't do his job or wouldn't be able to do his job without aides and comforts he would have never taken up the duty and responsibility. Based entirely on, and solely on that FACT I oppose, and I know my cousin Butch opposes this drone program BECAUSE if you can't do the job without aide and comfort then don't take on the duty and the responsibility. What, I wonder, say you all? Thanks! Have a blessed weekend.
Officer Carden Spencer of the Dallas Police Department shot Bobby Gerald Bennett outside Bennett’s home in the middle of the day on Monday. A police report on the incident claimed Bennett was walking toward Spencer and his partner and raised a knife “in an aggressive manner” before being shot, but surveillance video from a neighbor’s house shows Bennett rolling away from the cops prior to being shot.
A team at Stanford’s School of Medicine had their findings published this week in the journal Nature Communications, and their eye-catching result is being considered a big step to understanding how the brain operates, specifically in terms of numbers.

"... why has 'sexy' become such an important a thing to aspire to, particularly in a Halloween costume that could be clever, funny, tongue-in-cheek, could be so many other imaginative things, but instead has essentially rendered it weird and boring," said Tolman. "We're sexually commodifying corn, seriously?" And... Frog.

I think it's more a matter of how people consume media with gold fish attention spans
If You Read Only One Article About Hummingbird, Read This One! Hummingbird isn’t about long tail search. It’s entirely the opposite. Hummingbird is about taking long-tail, highly unusual and verbose searches, and serving them results as if they were clear short-phrase searches. It is applying semantics to the actual search query, and processing that, prior to actually running the results. There's a reason why even though Google said Hummingbird affected 90% of search queries, almost no webmasters noticed a change during the month it was live before Google publicly announced it. Here's the hard truth that many SEO's don't want to accept: you can't optimize for Hummingbird. (Update: By that last sentence I don't mean to imply SEO is no longer important. Far from it. It may be more important than ever, if in a changed form. But I think it's a mistake to try to optimize for Hummingbird itself. Rather, if you're doing the best kind of optimization that we've always done, you should be in good shape for Hummingbird. Thanks to + Max Minzer for pushing me to clarify that!) Hummingbird will best benefit the sites that have lots of very useful content that Google already ranks high for "traditional" keyword searches. It will simply help more searchers be able to connect with that content, even when they don't enter an exact match for the site's keywords.
That's going to be a challenge but mesh nets have sprung up in places.
Zen of Small Tasks: Be You "Semantic search affords telling our stories." -- + John Kellden #teahousesequence : catgifs, selfies, confusion, engagement, social presence An Analogy: Confusion is to Be Kind, what Engagement is to Be You. "Be Kind." -- Kurt Vonnegut "Be You." -- + David Amerland A Streetcar Named Intelligent Purposeful Self-Interest + David Amerland : In Google Semantic Search [ ] I wrote: “All marketing is a narrative but it is usually a fragmented one. How do you make sure that the message you project is cohesive?” The answer is disarmingly simple: be you. Authenticity, honesty, transparency, are what makes a narrative coalesce. They create the building blocks of its memorability. They become the stamp of its uniqueness. Ultimately we are each, a story. The greatest tragedy, perhaps, is if it remains untold. Semantic Search, Social Curation and Community as a Service Evolving 21st C literacies. Intersecting both Institutions, Markets and Commons as well as Data, Story and Narrative. A dynamic evolving fitness space reframed by automatic sensemaking and collaborative sensemaking through sharing content and context organized around shared interests augmented by algorithms. As a note to particularly interested readers: This post was crafted through searching for "semantic search" and "narrative" - the 7h item that came up, was David Amerlands post from which the above quote. In a nutshell, this means that Google works. This here very post is an instance of an annealing between people and algorithms. Cyborg if you will. People as relevance batteries in the Matrix. Although, I have to say, the Machines and Agents Smith's in this version of the movie are much more kind and forgiving. I could half do with more machine guns though...

Mindfulness and meditation are spiritual disciplines that should lead us to the practice of "authenticity" in our own living - being genuine, true to our self, honest with others. Mindfulness helps to connect us. We can only be connected when we are authentic.

Was there. Haven't watched video yet. Google walking map was incorrect. Also stopped by homeless people offering me money on my walk back to the hotel. Very cold in Chicago tonight and I was dressed for the weather.
Radioactivity levels in a well near a storage tank at the #Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan have risen immensely on Thursday, the plant’s operator has reported. Officials of the Tokyo Electric Power Company #TEPCO said on Friday they detected 400,000 becquerels per liter of beta ray-emitting radioactive substances - including strontium - at the site, a level 6,500 times higher than readings taken on Wednesday, NHK World reported. The storage tank leaked over 300 tons of contaminated water in August, some of which is believed to have found its way into the sea through a ditch. The well in question is about 10 meters from the tank and was dug to gauge leakage.
