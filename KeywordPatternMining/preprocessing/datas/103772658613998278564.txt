The only thing missing is the price, it looks like a rich man's toy, like so many other fun cars.
That's a reasonable price, assuming that a guy 2m tall can drive one. Nonadjustable seat not promising
Honestly, + Jeff Seelig I would give up the clutch if someone made an auto which shifts as well as manual. Stick is more fun, but my Cobra is not fun in stop and go traffic!
