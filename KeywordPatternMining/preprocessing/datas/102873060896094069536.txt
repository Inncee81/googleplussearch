This is complete horse shit. 1. there is absolutely no mention of Sony's online users anywhere in this garbage. 2. Sony does not release the numbers of their online base to anyone. NPD is full of shit. Would be great if you guys actually did what respectable journalists do and link to your source. Maybe that's because there is no actual source from NPD. Maybe you guys just did what tons of other website have done and that's copy stories without doing any actual fact checking. I've spent the better part of an hour trying to find an actual credible report from NPD and there isn't one. Tons of other websites copy and paste the same damn story tho. Others even have different numbers, some say 48% some 45 but mostly 50% and not a single one of them have a link to credible source. So WTF + Game Rant Where is the source?
Also many stories saying that the word actually came from Major Nelson and not exactly NPD. Either way NPD only does sales data. Sony does not disclose their online base to them or anyone.
