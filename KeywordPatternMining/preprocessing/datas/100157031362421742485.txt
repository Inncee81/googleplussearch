It's the outcome that counts. How you got there (or what gear you used doesn't matter). The big question is however: Can you get everything just the way you want it with every gear? The answer is no, there are limitations. Try to shoot a sporting event with a point and shoot or camera phone, no chance. Shoot a big brand billboard campaign in candle light with little noise with a small chip, no chance. So: is it the gear? No. Does gear matter? In some circumstances yes. Does expensive gear automatically produce great images: Hell no. What counts is the final image, and everything else is just a means to get it. Thank you + Michael Sutton for the hint ;)
