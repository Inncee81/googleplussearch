I think the biggest problem, for geeks anyway, is that tablets are where the Nexus lineup really shines. You don't have to worry about carrier BS. The updates are there. Because most people get Wifi tablets anyway you know you can have one, reliably, on a yearly basis. And the price is right also. It is really hard to get excited about tablets from oems because the software experience is so much shittier
Getting something that is stable day 1 is completely different from rooting and flashing and dealing with baked together ROMs and 3 months of bugfixing. And if you root and flash aosp it's essentially an admission that the oems software was trash. You may as well have gotten the Nexus anyway
I love rooting and flashing with the best of them but cyanogenmod or AOSP ROMs in general just isn't the same thing as getting functional stock the day the software comes out. GPE on the One and S4 is close to that but that still runs on top of sense or Touchwiz framework so that doesn't really enable the development community either
I also don't agree with giving an oem money for a software experience that you don't even want to use on a daily basis. You're only letting them justify what they're doing. With carriers a lot of times you can't help or control it, not everybody is on T-mo or AT&T and that isn't feasible. With tablets there is no excuse.
