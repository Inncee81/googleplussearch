What did you do, take a D800 with you? or did you time-lapse E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G ? ;-) Enjoying the pics, keep 'em coming
A photo is a photo, not matter the device that captures it. What is the best camera to capture a photo, the one you have on you when "THE" moment happens. However I agree with + Michael Sutton that there will always be those who criticise image capture that differs from their preferred method. However just because you have a different opinion does not make it correct, it's an opinion, just as what I have expressed above.
