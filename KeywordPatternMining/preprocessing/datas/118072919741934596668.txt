As you probably saw on many sites, Sony launched 3 new camera. I guess that we will see some housing popping out shortly. Most of the hipe is about A7 and A7R but from video point of view the RX10 has some amazing features: Integrated ND filters and stepless aperture ring. Unfortunately not interchangeable lens... Thsi article is focused on video aspects oft these new camera. In the next few days we will see more material coming out.

GH3 Demo reel I came across this video and I'm definitely sold Nice writeup on this camera + Nick Hope It's a shame that video can't be downloaded. From the turtle shot it seems that banding is not there. Slo-mo on macro is gorgeous
Are you happy with VIMEO? I chose Vimeo for it's superior quality and sharing options than YT. But now things are changing... Most people see video on mobile devices like smarthphones and tablet. I quickly discovered that Vimeo on these devices is years back. Their Android app is an offense to users. I do not know about the IOS version. They have a new "mobile" site that serves only SD material. They states that HD on a 'tiny' 3,5" display is useless... Unfortunately for them (and us) 99% of smartphones has a HD display. Moreover in this category fall all tablets with 1080p display. On android devices the normal desktop website doesn't play html5 stream hence no way to see a HD video on Android. Short story: if you think to share your work to your customers they'll end up seeing a pixelated version of your HD effort on their high end devices. Seriously thinking to switch to YT... Any feedback?
I see you point but when I share a video I expect it would be playable irrespective of the device. Currently android users get only SD content. Imagine you share a work with your customer and he cannot play it because he has a Samsung tablet/smartphone...
New GH3 glass dome Just saw this post of + Nick Hope on WP. I'm thinking to pull the trigger for my gh2
The Zi Costante shoal is located by the island of Giannutri, less than a mile out of Punta Secca. While it was a well known spot to local fishermen, it is a completely new discovery for scuba divers. The shoal is formed by large rocky reefs spaced out by sand and extends along several hundred meters. Only a small part of it has been explored underwater. The shallow points lie at about 55 m / 180 ft. Several cliffs slope to 90 m / 300 ft. Due to its depth, the shoal is within reach of technical divers. The shoal is rich of a great biodiversity and it appears to be in healthy conditions compared to other reefs of the island. We dove the North cliff which hosts, starting from 70 m / 230 ft a rather large colony of black coral (Antipathes subpinnata). We encountered 4 specimen of John Dory (Zeus Faber) in the one dive, which speaks for itself about the reef's condition. Currently, Argentario Divers argentariodivers.com is the only diving facility offering this dive.
Usually I would have thrown away those crappy shots but it doesn't happen everyday to find the ship's bell https://vimeo.com/68264945
It's not mine but of a friend of mine. And it remember me how the Mediterranean sea was... https://vimeo.com/65671400
This time I tried something more complicated of the usual uw music video. A lot to learn but also a lot fo fun. Given the cave logistic I had just one shot and... I completely screwed up all my shots. I spent several hours trying to fix them in post. This is the last time I will use the 8mm for uw video Anyway... Interview and underwater shots filmed on a Panasonic GH2 + Lumix 8mm + Yashica 50mm ML loaded with Flow Motion 2.02 settings; Nauticam Housing; 2x FIX Aquavolt3500 lights and 2x 50W HID Yellow Diving. Land shots filmed with a Canon 5DmkII + Canon 24-105mm + Yashica 80-200mm ML https://vimeo.com/59539217
Thanks Nick. It was the first time I shot in a cave. While I have the histogram enabled, it's very difficult to evaluate the correct exposure in such ambient. I got paranoid about DOF (stupid thing on a 8mm fisheye lens) so I used f6, ISO 1000 for all the shots. As result I got all clips underexposed of three stop at least. So it was a nightmare increasing exposure in post trying to preserve details. I could have used f4 or wide open f3.5. I would got some soft corner but perfect exposure. Furthermore the 8mm fisheye lens with a FOV of 180° is a PITA for video lighting. Again, with the small display it's impossible to evaluate that all the FOV is correctly covered. Lesson learned
I was wondering why Nauticam was not capitalizing his know how on photo housings... and this is their reply
BTW they told me it cost 10K euro... 1K per leg
Where is the boat? Strange way to reach the dive spot A wonderful cave South of Rome with a gin clear water. Here fo a check dive hoping to get back in January with a video setup.
water was 8 degrees Celsius Two undergarments and I was ok but I felt like a sausage...
I've just discovered (my fault) that + Manfred Bortoli with Daniele Iop and + Massimo Boyer have won the Palme d’Or, Prix SMY Ondina, Prix Ffessm for "The Giant and the fisherman" at Festival Mondial de l’image sous-marine. I saw the the video was featured also in the Miami Underwater Festival Congratulations!!!
Hi all. I've read something on storyboarding. Most of the books are on movie storyboard.what do you suggest for documentary storyboard? Bye
Hi Nick, I'm speaking of method and concepts about scripting and storyboarding for documentary

Hi, I'm an Italian amateur videographer based in Rome. While my latest video are focused mostly on underwater deep wrecks I like marine biology. For me tech diving is a "tool", is not an end in itself, only a means to an end. I wish those wrecks were shallow I shot with a Panasonic GH2 in a Nauticam Housing and I share my videos on my Vimeo page: https://vimeo.com/bocio/videos
Il 21 e 22 aprile si è tenuto a Roma il primo Scuba Show, una piccola ma interessante manifestazione subacquea in cui era possibile provare la maggior parte delle attrezzature esposte. I pochi stand erano infatti allestiti intorno alla piscina dei tuffi allo stadio del nuoto del Foro Italico. Reb, mute e scooter a parte, interessanti le attrezzature foto e video sub esposte. Nauticam, Easydive e Michitech esponevano le ultime novità. Nauticam La nuova custodia per la Panasonic Lumix GX-1 e diverse custodie della casa di Honk Kong. E' stato possibile provare in acqua la custodia per la Canon 600D. Michiteck L'azienda di Civitavecchia presentava i due nuovi fari CarboLed 8000 e CarboLed 5000, rispettivamente da 8000 e 5000.
