Mine came OTA when I woke this morning (G Nexus in Australia). Lost my root & Clockwork Mod recovery didn't want to install the update zip file but I pushed through half awake. Now just have to root again.
+ Lucas Nichols it's early days but I've been off charge for a couple of hours listening to podcasts and it used to be in the low 80's for me but 4.3 is 95 so I think it might be right. ï»¿ EDIT was actually no different please ignore as ZDbox was frozen at 95%
+ Lucas Nichols sorry misinformed you. ZDbox was frozen so it was saying 95% but it was actually 82% so business as usual :-(.
