+ Richard Devine I love my Nokia Lumia 520 (International Version). The screen can be used in winter with thick gloves, the battery is replaceable, and the Nokia Drive app provides free offline turn-by-turn navigation. And last night, I was very impressed by the camera's low light performance. I took a photo of a receipt in a semi-dark room and the resulting image, although quite noisy, was not that much worse than the one I got using an iPhone 5s. Thanks + Paul Thurrott for recommending this product. It is a great first smartphone and a terrific bargain.
