Funnily enough, my first 'serious' SLR camera was a Praktica - the FX2 which I got second-hand in 1977. Not even a pentaprism, the viewfinder was a ground-glass screen set in the top, with a flip-over magnifier for fine focus. No flash shoe (at all), but X and B sockets on the front of the body and a maximum shutter speed of 1/500. With 50mm and 135mm lenses and a hand-held light meter it lasted me well for a number of years.
