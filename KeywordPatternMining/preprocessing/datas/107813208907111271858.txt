I wish it had the long exposure preview like the omd or is that an olympus patent?
Love my nex 5r. My only complaint is that the LCD is very fragile. I was on a recent trip to NY with just the 5r and x100. I was running to catch the subway and apparently my plastic water bottle hit both my cameras inside my bag. The x100 was fine but my 5r has a spiderweb screen now. The lcd repair costs almost half the price of a 5r body.
