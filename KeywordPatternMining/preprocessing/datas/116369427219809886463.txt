I found smart connect is very limited, using Llama instead. Unlike tasker llama is much easier to pick up. worth trying
It wont on my xperia z. I have the luck to have it randomly tap on the home key.... And sometimes it will hold up the screen, other time it will treat my finder and waterdrop as multi touch. My solution, rise the phone above head and so much less water drop on it....if i have to use it during bath.
