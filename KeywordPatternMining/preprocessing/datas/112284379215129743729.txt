Wow, the comments were abundant. A popular topic. I fall in with most of them. The fixed blade is there. My folder is a Swiss Army with pliars, and my hatchet had a hammer end for tent stakes.
Great information. I know how a vehicle can affect the magnetic field. If I set my compass on the center of my dashboard, it spins the needle 1/4.
