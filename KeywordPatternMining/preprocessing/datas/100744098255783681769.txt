I really wonder if Google is actually leaking all this stuff on purpose or if they really can't keep the lid on anything. I mean look at all the leaks in the past weeks. Amazing.
And I still miss that little yellow Streetview guy. How am I supposed to BROWSE streetview imagery? I bet they killed him on purpose to conserve bandwidth.
+ Jason Allen Yes I know. Thanks. The thing is: I like to BROWSE the street view imagery. So the point is to actually see where in the world the street view cars have been without having to double click every street on earth. ;-)
I know. I mean this: The blue area showing you where street view imagery is available. Great for browsing far away lands ... ;-)
+ Jason Allen You see this if you grab the "old" little yellow man in the old map interface and drag it to the map. Then you get the overlay and can choose where to go.
