+ Tim Gray Check out Aio Wireless (subsidiary of AT&T) - same network, same coverage, no contracts, and just $70 for unlimited everything with 7GB data - The ONLY downside is a d/l speed cap at 8 Mbps for 4G/LTE. However, that's faster than what I get at home and so far the service has been awesome!
+ Lee Waters Hell no! 1) CDMA (non-starter right there), 2) You can't use your own phone, 3) They're only as reliable as the free public wifi hotspots available (not good), 4) Using Sprint?? lololol. Plus a 5GB cap on data and you're reduced to 2G. No thanks
