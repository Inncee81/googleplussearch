This article caught my eye as well. I've been looking to pick up an 11" air for some time. Until recently the processors weren't up to speed. (and now that they are, my wallet isn't up to speed!) I love what I'm reading above. But, if I have to wait until 2nd half of 2014, that might be too far out. We'll see.
I will. In good time. (Have some house related stuff to attend to first.)
the big question: Would you give up your full featured PC (MBA) for what's basically an "mostly-online only" Chromebook?
(being devil's advocate) ... and a Chromebook is a fraction of the price. Is this the future of computing? Have we gone full circle back to "dumb terminals" ??

They never transitioned well after Windows Mobile. They were the kings back then. Perhaps they stayed too loyal to Microsoft as Android took over the non - Apple space.
