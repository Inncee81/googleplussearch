I understand that, they've made too many mistakes the past 2-3 years now.
I think their biggest loss was to release One X+ shortly after X was released. They must have tons of One X lying around that no one buys. Same with the Sensation-series also.
Now when HTC won't ship devices with Beats anymore they loose many music lovers too..
