That's about full size. To find, just right-click and save the above picture as, then drag and drop it into the google images search bar. It shows every instance of that image online ;) I guess you guys never saw that show Catfish? lol I use that to see if people are using fake profiles too. Take their profile image and do the same, and if it comes up on a ton of other profiles with different names, then its a spammer.
You would be surprised how useful it is. Even if you only have a piece of an image it will find the matching images online. Catfish is the show where people meet online and go to meet each other and it ends up being a completely different person. I saw them do it on there one time and I was amazed.
Are those prices you guys pay for games a flat rate or do you go by condition? Like if I was interested in getting rid of my near mint boxed Hagane or Musha, would I get more because of the condition or is it a one size fits all deal?
I beat it with save-states on my Mame cab. It's very hard. Basically a really souped up ninja gaiden with a bit of ninja spirit thrown in for good measure. I've been looking to sell some of my stuff recently. My collection was actually featured on retrogamescollector last week. I've been building a shop into my existing website but if I find the right place I might drop them elsewhere.
I'll keep it in mind. Nice Flintstones. I have a near mint boxed copy of Dragon Fighter, that's my NES headliner. The full Shining Series for the Saturn. It's still one of those decisions that I haven't quite come to terms with yet. I could end up staying a greedy hoarder when it comes time to do it lol
I like that they went so deep as to include grim fandango.
