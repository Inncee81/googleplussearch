It doesn't really surpass the Canon SX50. They're both 1200mm. I already have the Canon SX50 and bought the FZ70 to see how it compared. It was a major fail. It's a good camera, but the only ways it surpasses the SX50 would be in the software operations it performs. For example, the automatic mode for the FZ70 will automatically take 2 exposures when it senses a overexposed background and blend them together. This camera is great for the inexperienced or those that favor automatic modes, but if image quality is more important, take a close look at the SX50. Don't believe the specs alone, look at some actual photos.
I find it humorous that she can't say what this "underlying social contract" is. It's called the Constitution, but since much of it doesn't agree with her agenda, she doesn't want to bring it up. Did this poor woman ever find her lost tribe by the way?
