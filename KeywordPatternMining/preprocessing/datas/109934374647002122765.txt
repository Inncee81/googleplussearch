What a great way to start the day!
My local camera shop here in West Michigan is Norman Camera. They have a nice product selection (good to premium brands) and a very knowledgeable staff.
Yes, look at LOTS of photos! I think photography is like training for a marathon. The more you run, the better runner you become. Finally, don't give up!
Oh, and it's not only honing your talent as a photographer, but learning good business skills.
