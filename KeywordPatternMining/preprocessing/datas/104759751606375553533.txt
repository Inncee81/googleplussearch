It was such a hit in about 2000. Everyone had a Walkman CD player. The new Walkmans are great. People should give them a chance over the over rated iPod.
Camera. I wish you guys would release your phones on CDMA networks. Im such a fan of Sony phones and the new Xperia but its only on GSM networks and Im not a fan of AT&T or T-Mobile in anyway.
+ Sony I love you guys. Do you think you would ever consider making your phones work on CDMA networks?

Oh wow a tour? That's awesome. I've noticed Microsoft has been really cracking down on XB1 advertisement. There was a xb1 selling opportunity (specifically for xb1) for the Christmas season.
I've seen a lot for ps4 actually. Nothing for XB1. Which is STRANGE because that's normally not the case at all. Perhaps both companies are trying to advertise first to audience they know they didn't capture last generation.
The Taco bell advert for PS4 as well as the "Greatness awaits" has been everywhere. I only seen the XB1 ones a couple of times. Could be the TV shows I watch though.
I don't see why there is anything bad to say about it. Its an improvement upon the already great X360 controller in all the places that needed improvement. Those force feedback triggers sound so cool. Worst part about it is the price.
They do indeed have many factual and good points regarding the benefits of the console. Except the "Only console to play Titanfall" is not true when Steambox and that Piston PC console that launches the same day as it will also be able to play it. The YOUR CHOICE section is also humorous that they have to reiterate they reversed their policies. But seriously, if you primarily play CoD and NFL it's a great purchase. Does everything you'd want it to.
+ Jon Horner Just a speculation on how "exclusive" of a game it really is. It's console exclusive, but PC players can still get it on Games for Windows.
+ Jason Long But that's not exactly a bad thing. Sports are huge worldwide, and shooters are big in NA. I think one of the main problems are that not everyone wants a Kinect. They should know this when they sold Kinect-less X360 consoles and not. I would have never paid the $300 for a 4gb X360 model with Kinect. But I paid the $300 for the 320gb WITHOUT the kinect. People prefer a choice. The $100 more expensive tag than their major competition doesn't help much either.
Cooool. I would buy nintendo network games also playable on mobile on WiiU then.
Dude thats awesome. Let me know if the game is any good
