Thanks for sharing this album Ananda. They are wonderful photos!
Lovely shot Ananda. Is this meant to move? It says autoawesome.
So not exactly a light bulb moment then? ;) Interesting shot.
Great job Ananda. A really interesting shot with its shapes and light and shade. Fascinating!
Goodnight Ananda! Interesting image but I'm not sure what it is exactly.
