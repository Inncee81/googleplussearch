Thanks got my voucher but answer me this why are all the films only available in SD not HD when my phone features a 1080 display?
Nope - using the Video Unlimited app on my UK Xperia Z I only get the option to rent or buy films in SD - On my Bravia TV using the built in Video Unlimited I can download HD content.
