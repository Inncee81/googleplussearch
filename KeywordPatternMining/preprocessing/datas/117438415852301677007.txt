On TWIP 329 you covered the Nikon 610, I'm a D600 owner and during summer vacation in Yellowstone I noticed the sensor dust/oil issue but didn't get around to sending the D600 back to Nikon for cleaning until mid September. It seemed to be taking way to long to get the camera back and every time I checked the status it said 'Waiting for part". I just got the D600 back a few days ago and much to my surprise they replaced the entire shutter with what I think is the shutter from the D610. And with firmware upgrade I think I have most of the improvements of the 610.
