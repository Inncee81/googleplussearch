Well, it's not the first time Sony stabbed Brazil in the back. When PS3 came out, the original price was 3.000 US dollars.So I guess We (Brazilians) are already used to being Sony's clowns.
+ Ryan B You don't know what you are talking about. Sony has a huge factory here and The PS3 is already manufactured in Brazil . So it has nothing to do with import taxes.and it is Sony fault. Less than a month ago Sony themselves announced that the price for the ps4 would be a fair . This is outrageous. It's not about having money.I bet all the gamer community disagrees on this price.
