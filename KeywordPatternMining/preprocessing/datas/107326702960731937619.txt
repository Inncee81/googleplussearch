Nice to see gps, but I'm not going to jump at upgrading since it is a different size case and not big difference in video. Wonder if it does higher resolution images than 1080p?
And the new case is only rated for 5m depth in water? Whaaat?
+ Ricardo Nojima interesting. I'll check into that. I just bought the underwater and acoustic doors for the first case.
I updated 3 of my computers today to 8.1 without any problems! Love it on both workstations and laptops/tablets. Can run all the best software and manage all my files better than any other device. Doubles as pc and tablet! Why are people complaining? The start screen is great for clean access to you programs and apps. Very fast task switching, and more...
