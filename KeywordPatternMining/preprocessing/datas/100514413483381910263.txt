Having some issue with the DUO 13. The pen is not so responsive in Note Anytime for VAIO. It lags quite often. Notes Anytime may like stops responding even when changing pen style or colors. I've to put the stylus very close to the screen before it can be detected. The 2 buttons not responding quite often as well. Does it sound like problem with my digital stylus?
