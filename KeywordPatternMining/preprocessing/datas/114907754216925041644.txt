"As a travel and landscape photographer, the tripod is my best partner along the way. Even if you go for a long expedition and you have to pack light, make sure you put a small tripod in your backpack. It will allow you to take sharper pictures, take long exposures, night shots, etc. You will get more creative and you will see how the interest of your pictures raises to a new level." - + Enrique Pacheco Photography WATCH ENRIQUE'S TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY HERE: #timelapse #photography #iceland #travelphotography + Billy Taylor
