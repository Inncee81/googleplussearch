Good question… no idea! Admittedly, "ranking buddhas" is a phenomena almost as old as Buddhism: Theravadins very quickly ranked paccekabuddha lower than sāvakabuddha itself lower than samyaksambuddha… Usually, it is quite easy to see how self-serving all these various rankings are. Which might, of course, still be the truth (and it is purely coincidental that it is self-serving)… or might be a manifestation of 'clinging' to a sense of 'superior' self ;-)
Indeed Japan was quite in disarray at the time, torn by wars and famine and persecutions… Nichiren thought this partly was the karmic consequences of the perversion of Buddhism by previous schools. The notion of "Latter days of the dharma" was in full swing too and many teachers saw the local situation as a confirmation…
