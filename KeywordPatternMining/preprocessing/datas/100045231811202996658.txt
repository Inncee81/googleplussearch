+ Alexander Maxham are you kidding me....lg skin is even heavier than touchwiz
I hate phone commercials like this. Where they bash other companies in a way that isn't even comical. Motrola x and the windows rt have awesome advertising.
+ Alexander Maxham not saying it's slow. It just looks really heavy and ugly to me. Not that touchwiz isn't
+ Justin Martin everyone has their opinion...lg g2 isn't a phablet.
+ Namra Alivio if you're going to say that samsun g is laggy you're an idiot. Its not the fastest. But it doesn't LAG. You clearly don't know how to use android. If you use nova launcher and increase animation speeds any slowness is practically eliminated.
It's not lag lag. You get occasional dropped frames. That's about it. If I had a root available for my GS4 with unlocked boot loader, I would put on cyanogen mod.
