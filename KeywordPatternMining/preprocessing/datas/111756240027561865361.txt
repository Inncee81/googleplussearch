Re the new Nikon underwater camera. I do a lot of sea kayaking / Mt Biking multi day trips, where you want a "go anywhere, I don't have to worry about it" light weight camera. At the moment I use a Panasonic TS3. Fantastic little camera that gives adequate results on well lit days, but not so good in the bush or other low light situations. ( ) The Nikon promises the same weatherproofing and ruggedness, but with a larger sensor, and better quality glass, thus hopefully giving better low light performance. From my perspective, a win win and something I have been hoping for for quite awhile.
