I have been using windows 8 for a few months. I havent tried it on a touch screen yet though. I don't see what all the fuss is about? I think it is decent, way better than a apple product like Mountain lion or ferrel cat or whatever it is called. Cant wait until 8.1 downloads today. The start screen is starting to grow on me and I thin the improvements will only make this experience better
Use the internet, and use Adobe Lightroom, some netflix....I would say that is most of my usage.
+ George Hayes I am misunderstanding you I think. Why can't you do all that in the desktop?
Oh jeez, so I just updated my new low end Acer laptop to 8.1 and well it works because I am typing this now. But I am getting a RunDLL error upon startup now...guess I will wait to update my other computer from 8 to 8-1
