The good old days :-P long live the cassette
With the winter fast approaching not a bad idea to have a waterproof device here in the UK :-P
I have used many smartphones but I can honestly say Sony is Simply the Best! I only wish they had adopted Android sooner. Whatever device you choose in the Sony Family you will not be disappointed.. Great phone.. Great aftercare and customer support.
Honestly there is nothing better than Sony products :--)
+ Sony Xperia I have the Z currently away for a repair at your workshop I am missing it .. Sony make the best overalls smartphones. Looks, feel and power!
+ Gordon Simpson I had early problems with my Z and battery life have you updated it? I have owned the Note 2 but the plastic feel and saturated screen really put me off.

Sony make great tech I think when consumers purchasing different products from the same manufacturer they expect it to fit into a nice-Eco system where each device works with the other I think Sony are starting to do that.
