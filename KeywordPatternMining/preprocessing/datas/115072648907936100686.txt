I worry about allowing my email address (in one shape or another) the ability to access my bank account. I couldn't find much on the security behind the curtains other than Square is PCI DSS compliant. My response is "So What!" TJMax and other are compliant and have had security issues as well. So someone can spoof my mail addy and remove funds from my account. Scary.... I need a little more "proof" that this is really locked down.
