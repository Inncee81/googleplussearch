If nothing else, looks like they abandoned the awkward bold/light mix in times/timers. Never did understand what they were thinking with that one.
Hmmm, the article headline (theirs, not yours) seems a bit misleading. In every other respect, I've never been much of an Apple fan, but I do think the predictions of iPhone's imminent death are demonstrably premature. That this year's record-breaking sales have consisted more of the 5S than the 5C is, I imagine, a shock that Jony Ive can live with! ;-)
