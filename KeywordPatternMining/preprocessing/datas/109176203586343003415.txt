Mini Disc? does anyone remember? They " Sony Hi Fi heads, would listen and listen till they got it Right! i still to this day own and use my deck daily. how old is it ? 13 years young, it was 'in its beginning meant to do away with awful mp3 codec; which was thrown together by 2 nerf balls. ATRAC "minidisc" was put lovingly together by SONY .its ashame that people didnt understand or were acclimatised to mp3. Another nail into minidisc required more energy as a portable vs mp3 , Then you have Apple who monopolised the letter " i " they threw it in front of everthing they marketed and yes all the way to a phone. shame on u guys. Just remember a 256Mps mp3 Started out as an ATRAC codec!
