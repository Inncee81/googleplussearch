Peter, this is so sweet! You got the perfect light too. Gorgeous!
Sounds like a pretty incredible mentality but I can see how the "fresh air" (and a lunchtime dip in the ocean) really could do us desk people some good. Have a great workcation!
I rarely say, "That wasn't worth it." More often I find myself saying, "I wish I had..." So good for you!
