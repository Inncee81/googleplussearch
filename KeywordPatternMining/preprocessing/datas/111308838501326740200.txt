Oh dear... Despite originating in the UK, Burberry is seen as a very crass brand. It's Popular with uneducated "neds", "chavs" and wannabe footballer's (read soccer player's) wives who... if they're lucky... end up getting some minor fame through a sex tape with said sportsmen. Put it this way, it could very well be Kim kardashian's perfect label!
