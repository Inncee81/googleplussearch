wrong community. You really sound desperate trying to find anything that seems negative towards the PS4 ...a game being delay is not a big deal for anyone.
The PS4 launch line looks better imo. Which XB1 launch line you like the most?
Yes + Richard Dixon lol. Also ser: • Everybody is Going to the Rapture • Rime (similar to ICO & Journey) • Helldivers (great co-op/online game) • Resengun • Shadow of the Beast (looks bad ass) Sony also confirms unannounced titles from Naughty Dog, Sony Santa Monica and Media Molecule
+ Jason Long most spent most of its underground conferences time talking about indie policies and strategies... At least Sony showed actual games﻿. And since when free to play is a bad thing?
+ Richard Dixon not into indie games? Okay I understand... But Sony still managed to show more big budget titles. MS' new announcement was Fable. Sony revealed at least 6 big budget game for PS4 while also confirming 3 more from respectable studios
I like free to play... Nothing wrong with that. Killer instinct is a step in the right direction (I think there's another f2p game on 360 coming soon about Tanks)
You say more doesn't mean better... Then you talk sales as if sales = quality. Hypocrite much? More means more options... And most gamers like more options
+ Richard Dixon it does. I also can't wait to hear more about PS4 exclusive Deep Down at TGS
I shared because not many people know about this game...my bad
Who cares if it sales more...quality of the game is what matters. Okami, ICO, Shadow of the Colossus, FF7, Bayonetta, Demon's Souls all sold like shit. They are still great gsmes
Zelda is another good example.
