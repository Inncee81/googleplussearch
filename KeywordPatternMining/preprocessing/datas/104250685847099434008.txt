In my experience, only people who extensively used iOS have an issue with the back and up buttons on Android because none of them behave like the back button on iOS. The Android back button (should) behave like the back button in your web browser. The Android up button (should) often behave like the back button except when you come from another apps when it (should) helps you to navigate up in the app screens hierarchy until you reach the main screen of the app. The main issue is that a lot of app developers are coding it wrong .
