Actually + Derek Ross most if not all custom ROMs don't come with undervolted custom kernels, they prefer users use them on their own, that way they complain to their kernel dev about issues. And your statement + Alexander Maxham about "stock android" battery being worse than CM or AOSP is ignorant. Stock android is AOSP... Can't say CM is anymore because they're going to CAF for all their sources now. There is no difference. I've never had complaints about battery life on the N4 and it'll undoubtly be worse than the Nexus 5's. Remember, the new N7 has a smaller battery than its predecessor and has nearly double the battery life. It too has a much higher resolution screen as well as a much more powerful SoC. Now then, quit with all the whining about the meanial bump in mAh.
