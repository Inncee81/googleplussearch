We are meeting a bit earlier than usual but I believe this is a great excuse for it. The HARRY RANSOM CENTER at THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN has a current exhibition "Radical Transformation: Magnum Photos into the Digital Age". This appears to be an excellent exhibition to explore and enjoy. Here is the link for the exhibition information and the Harry Ransom Center. Entry is free but donations are accepted. We are meeting in front at 5 pm sharp to go inside. After enjoying the exhibition, we are walking through UT and heading to Spider House down Guadalupe to continue with the Drinking part of our Drink and Click™. Remember, this month challenge is Shadows. In the western hemisphere October bring us Halloween. For the rest of the world October carries a spooky feeling which appears to drag from this side of the planet. Shadows appears to be a good median between the spooky and the mysterious side of shadows. Not necessarily has to be scary but a good shadow interpretation can rock this competition. Remember the images have to be taken during a Drink and Click™ Event. This month prizes brought to you by our awesome sponsors: 1st Place prize from + Think Tank Photo 2nd Place prize + c't Digital Photography One Year Magazine Subcription 3rd Place + Stuck In Customs $20 off for any of + Trey Ratcliff 's tutorials or pre-sets

We Talked About Yongnuo Flashes, but How About Their Triggers? For $19.39? Hell Yes Same deal. I bought these for Nikon years ago but they work on Canon, Olympus, Fuji, etc. I have two commanders and four triggers. Once again they have never failed me. Long distance range in case you want to get fancy. These definitely do the job. You have a wider variety of triggers from their same brand now a few years later, so check those too.

Yongnuo 560 II – The Little $59 Flash That Could I have been using this flash for the last 5 months. I sold my two Nikons SB-600 and got three Yongnuo. Two 560 II and one 560 III. They have never failed me. They go up to 1/128 power and they also have zoom. Here is the link for those who asked before. Click the image below to see in Amazon. Posted by + Juan Gonzalez
