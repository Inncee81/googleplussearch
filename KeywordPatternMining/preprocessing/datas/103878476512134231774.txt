+ 孫和輝 Higher megapixels are not the leading factor for what you call "noise". It's the size of the pixel in the CCD sensor that's the issue with image quality. Generally on higher resolution sensor, the pixels have to be smaller to fit all of them in there, unless the CCD sensor is a lot larger like in an DSLR. The limit of 8 megapixel is there lessen the stress of all the calculations and multiple exposers to achieve the pictures enhancements that Bioz is providing. If not, you'd be waiting quite a while for each picture before you cold view it. Also, it wouldn't be able to take multiple exposers to compose the idea photo for you. When the phone takes a picture at 8 megapixels, it just processes and stores the image at 8. It's still using the same 20 megapixel CCD sensor.
Here's how it works. If you open the camera app with the Camera icon, it'll use your last used settings, so if you used manual with flash off, it'll start up with manual with flash off. However, if you open the camera in the lock screen, or by holding down the physical camera button on the side, it'll start up in auto mode. That's designed that way so that you can act quickly to capture something right away without worrying about white balance and exposure.
+ 真岛秀和 Yes… that's true, but does what you call better software matter more or does the ability to know how to strike a balance between f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO sensitivity mean more? Can the software help you fix a poor framed photo? Can software fix a lack of a meaningful narrative in your photos? Which factor affects the end result of the photo more, software or talent?
+ Xingo Luo Better in all measurable means? Better in the sense that I'll never take a bad picture with and iPhone 5S? Better in then sense that every picture I'll take with an Z1 will make the viewers of my pictures go, "That's an okay photo, but it would have looked better if took it with an iPhone 5S." I use both everyday. Work provides me with an iPhone to us as a company phone. I use a Z1 personally. I've taken some great pictures with the iPhone and I've taken some great pictures with the Z1. I've also taken some horrible pictures with both. Yeah, that flash on the iPhone is very innovative. Yeah, the Z1 has a "shutter" button that I can use underwater. Look one is usually marginally better in different situations. If I took 20 pictures throughout the day of different subjects and cropped them to a same aspect ratio and scaled them slightly to a common resolution could you tell which one of the 40 pictures were taken by an iPhone, or which ones were taken by the Z1? Could the majority of the people tell? Would 20 of them be astounding, and 20 of them induce vomit? How about taking all this effort into spitting hairs and putting towards understanding the art of photography more?

The phones might not me shown in scale here, but I haven't gone as far as counting pixels and doing the necessary math. Maybe 3mm makes a big difference for some people, but personally it wouldn't have known if I hadn't looked at the specs. I own both.

Can the software help you fix a poor framed photo? Can software fix a lack of a meaningful narrative in your photos? Which factor affects the end result of the photo more, software or talent?
+ Xingo Luo Better in all measurable means? Better in the sense that I'll never take a bad picture with and iPhone 5S? Better in then sense that every picture I'll take with an Z1 will make the viewers of my pictures go, "That's an okay photo, but it would have looked better if took it with an iPhone 5S." I use both everyday. Work provides me with an iPhone to us as a company phone. I use a Z1 personally. I've taken some great pictures with the iPhone and I've taken some great pictures with the Z1. I've also taken some horrible pictures with both. Yeah, that flash on the iPhone is very innovative. Yeah, the Z1 has a "shutter" button that I can use underwater. Look one is usually marginally better in different situations. If I took 20 pictures throughout the day of different subjects and cropped them to a same aspect ratio and scaled them slightly to a common resolution could you tell which one of the 40 pictures were taken by an iPhone, or which ones were taken by the Z1? Could the majority of the people tell? Would 20 of them be astounding, and 20 of them induce vomit? How about taking all this effort into spitting hairs and putting towards understanding the art of photography more?
+ Stephan Kretschmann , The Z1 in 5mm taller and 3mm wider. Thickness is more less the same (0.6mm). The phones might not me shown in scale here, but I haven't gone as far as counting pixels and doing the necessary math. Maybe 3mm makes a big difference for some people, but personally it wouldn't have known if I hadn't looked at the specs. I own both.
+ 孫和輝 Higher megapixels are not the leading factor for what you call "noise". It's the size of the pixel in the CCD sensor that's the issue with image quality. Generally on higher resolution sensor, the pixels have to be smaller to fit all of them in there, unless the CCD sensor is a lot larger like in an DSLR. The limit of 8 megapixel is there lessen the stress of all the calculations and multiple exposers to achieve the pictures enhancements that Bioz is providing. If not, you'd be waiting quite a while for each picture before you cold view it. Also, it wouldn't be able to take multiple exposers to compose the idea photo for you. When the phone takes a picture at 8 megapixels, it just processes and stores the image at 8. It's still using the same 20 megapixel CCD sensor.
Here's how it works. If you open the camera app with the Camera icon, it'll use your last used settings, so if you used manual with flash off, it'll start up with manual with flash off. However, if you open the camera in the lock screen, or by holding down the physical camera button on the side, it'll start up in auto mode. That's designed that way so that you can act quickly to capture something right away without worrying about white balance and exposure.
+ 真岛秀和 Yes… that's true, but does what you call better software matter more or does the ability to know how to strike a balance between f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO sensitivity mean more?
