7 is more portable I use that more I had a 10 as a review unit for a month and it was awesome I want to buy one but my main usage is mobile. So the 10 better at home or while out. Commute everyday and what I throw in my back pack is my N7. Plus N7 cheaper I would go that route
Oh I have a transformer prime as well I let the kids use it lol N7 with me 24/7
