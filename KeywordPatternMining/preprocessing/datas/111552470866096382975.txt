For once, Google is doing it right. It looks like they will have stock and proper availability when this thing gets announced. None of this having to wait for months before you can actually buy the thing.
This is the original Holiday Miracle plan from just over two years ago. I pay $40/month for this. The only difference is the new roaming rates. Since I got my plan, Wind has raised their International and US roaming rates. They now charge extra for "preferred" roaming rates, which are just what they were before. This $50 plan includes them. But it's not worth it for the extra $70/year since you can just add them for one month when you're planning to travel. If you do travel to the US on a regular basis though, Wind is a no brainer. It would save you hundreds if not thousands a month over Robelus.
