+ Peter Doughman that's not a Nexus 5 display. Its used for the Nexus 7, chromecast, and chromebooks.
+ Artem Russakovskii the person who posted the photo is still trying to claim he has seen the final layout and its for the Nexus 5. Eventhough every person who works at best buy and who has the final layout up says otherwise. So ridiculous.
