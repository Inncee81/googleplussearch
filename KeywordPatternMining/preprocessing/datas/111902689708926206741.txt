having a smart phone that does everything is all well and good but I'd like to see someone start pushing the limit's of battery life, 4 days between charges with medium to heavy usage or more with all the features of a high end smart phone, that would be my ideal phone, I don't mind if the phone was considerably thicker or bigger as a result, I'm sure other people would like the longer battery life too.
+ Rob Foxx it is a shame, as it stands with the battery life i'll probably end up getting either a note 2 or a note 3 with a mugen battery pack or something similar, shame because i like the sony phones. On the limited internal storage though i guess they done that to help push there cloud storage solution, which is fine i suppose if you have enough data allowance from your carrier.
