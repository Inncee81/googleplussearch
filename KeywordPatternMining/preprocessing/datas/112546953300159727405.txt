#save4 Super and fantastic. One thing I like, and that's important when doing shillouettes, is how the subjects aren't touching. Since there's just an outline of the subject, it's important that they are all complete and and not intersecting with each other, as they would take on an odd form otherwise. High fives.
#save Nice. First impression is it could use more black slider. However, I know once it goes past a certain level it looks too contrasty. And this is teetering on pulling out all the detail. Nice non-halo'd, non-oversaturated, and well composed shot.
+ Raphael Drobot TIHTTL could be a new meme for the group. NNTBR
#delete10 Over processing actually overshadows that this is a crooked photo of a dormant windsock in an open field.
My answer... it's just an option. Maybe having raw files in the cloud benefits us in terms of backups. But my main concern is, why do people yell (all caps) raw when they are talking about raw files. Raw isn't a freaking acronym or a file extension, it's a word. Every time I read someone yelling talking about RAW files, I see a 1990's Michael Myers yelling RAW. Don't know why.
+ Gino Barasa Absolutely. That's how I read it in my little peanut of a head (acted out by a 1990's Michael Myers). Yeah, I'm tapped... maybe.
+ Gino Barasa All my (bad) joking aside... I think the 80/20 rule in this world (which applies to everything, not just photography) has changed to like 95/5. Everyone is the same. It's not the clouds fault, it's the 95% of the masses who WANT their data to be owned by someone else. I think models like this will segregate the playing field, where there no longer be levels of bad-good-better-fantastic photography. Pretty soon 95% of photography will be great, and 5% will be high end uber-fantastic.
+ Gino Barasa high five brotha. Hey, hope all is well over in your neck of the woods.
