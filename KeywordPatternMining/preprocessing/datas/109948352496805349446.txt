The best thing is the ability to make your own, and put Steam OS on it. I wonder if some people will make them to sell them on, like the good old PC days?
I am going to give it one year, or over, and switch at Xmas 2014 if I don't like it. I switch to a PS4 or Steambox.
I don't understand all the fuss about Titanfall, the PS4 has Killzone. Just enjoy your games!
I tried it for a week, got sick of all the notifications, now blocked!!!ï»¿ I must say it was very addicitive when I played and can see how they can make so much money. I never paid for a life, etc.
Is that globally?
Knack does look fun and good, and I wonder what LBP hub is about? I liked the original.
Killzone was the biggest disappointment at E3.
I just want Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs, but the free digital copy of Fifa 14 is good too. Happy.
Sony has nothing to worry about. I have always had a PS since the late 90s. I am buying an Xbox for myself (not my son) to see if the grass is greener on the other side. I got a feeling as soon as an exclusive game (e.g. Uncharted 4) is bundled with the PS4, with a PS Vita, I probably will switch.
I am not too impressed with MS pricing policy with apps at the moment. There seems to be no synergy like Android and iOS.
Are you not better off buying one of those Android sticks and have access to all Play Games?
