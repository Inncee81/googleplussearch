Nex 7 was/is a crazy good camera, and this offering looks like they took that and smashed a full frame sensor into it! I'm excited to start seeing what people can do with it.

I honestly wish more people would refuse to download this type of crap. Don't call it free than make the game unplayable unless you pay. Even the shareware model is more user friendly. Let them test it out and then pay a one time to unlock the rest of the game.
I think I have better things to do than worry about when this may or may not happen. Don't get me wrong. I'm excited to see the new phone and the new OS update, but I'm not wasting my time speculating over kitkat bars.
Yup, I had 30 seconds for that. The point was, it'll happen when it happens, no point getting worked up about when that might be. Until someone comes out and says it'll be on this day or that, it's all speculation and pointless. + MobileSyrup could be spending time posting about stuff that actually matters, not candy bar tweets. BTW: Are you feeling OK + John Aschwanden ? You seem to have a touch of troll.
