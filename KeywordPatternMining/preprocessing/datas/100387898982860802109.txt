+ Stuff I think your definition of "budget" needs re-evaluating. Or they're paying you too much money. I would say under £200/250 ish would fall in to the budget bracket. Anything above that should be mid-range.
And their billing system. I have been arguing with them for eight whole months trying to get an accurate bill from when they put the wrong roaming package on my account when I went on holiday in January. They keep crediting things then deducting things, but they won't do it until the next bill, and the next bill is never right! All the while I am paying for their mistakes.
