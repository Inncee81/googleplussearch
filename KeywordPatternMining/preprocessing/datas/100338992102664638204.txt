Re the Apple fingerprint scanner. Yep, the iPhone 5S fingerprint scanner "just works" (reliable, smooth, and it means the hardware home button can perform the user's choice of any six functions - turn on screen, unlock screen, activate siri, go to last app, go to home, and switch app - using a single interaction). I can understand why some Android fans would feel frustrated that Apple could turn this gimmick into a linchpin user experience. Tellingly, it seems to augur that the hardware home button will remain a signature of iOS devices for a while longer. It also works on arbitrary skin patches, so if the angle of your grip means you press your home button with the inner edge of your thumb, then that’s all the scanner needs to work with and the NSA gets virtually no advantage.
Why would Apple want to expand into the cheap market?
+ Greg Hortin that’s an interesting rationale but I’m still surprised. Making a cheap model ie. specs going backwards, would surely create unnecessary fragmentation that they would be keen to avoid; keeping the specs going forward but removing their margins would surely undermine their main sales, overwhelm their already limited manufacturing speed, and distort their brand perception. Apple has always been a niche player and is already selling about 6m iPhones per quarter in China (10%, compared to Samsung’s 12m). Given its criticisms of Android vendor tactics, I’d expect it to maintain its own position rather than play other companies’ tactics in their space.
That’s awesome. For the time being you can ‘cheat’ with the iPhone (or any other fast camera) in a couple of ways. One is just to press the shutter button several times quickly in a row – at least one of them ends up being focussed. The other option is to record burst/continuous mode with autofocus, then you get a stream of rapid-fire shots at each focus distance – this is also useful if you don’t know exactly when is the best moment to take the shot.
