Its the right community + DUN DEAL I've been posting for monthsss I've kinda got an idea which article belongs (dont get hung up on the title)... just read the article its like a shoe it fits + michael stolley
+ Craig Barratt + DUN DEAL + Kevin Hairston II It fits...And it fits cause it Negatively talks about PS4 Launch Line up...say what u will..but hooked on phonics works for adults as well....Would the PS4 Fans post a negative article in their community....No!!!! But this Xbox community member did!!!! I did it to show our members that Xbox one still has the best Launch Titles. #ArticleFits !!! ﻿ We Praise Ours & We Bash Theirs ﻿(Da Motto)
+ Daniel Roca pop from under the Rock...U know how everyone feels about u in this community. Wrong Community!!!! since E3 you have been commenting in the wrong community.. still haven't posted your PSN gamer tag u scuuuurrrddd.. + DUN DEAL known 1 told you u to comment on my post & if you don't like the logic you can kick rocks & give a couple of fucs while u @ it ..last I check Gamers never grow up...you might wanna check your community card SON !! #Kornball
+ Craig Barratt I can respect your opinion...I have been posting news in this Community for Months & if its positive news for the Xbox 1 I'll post it thats what members do in this community...Contrast to PS4 members posting negative articles about the system. ..
