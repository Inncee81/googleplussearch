LG G 2's better Nexus 5 look like it was made for girls specially with that wallpaper
y'all want a Man phone get the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
To me the more a cell phone does the better it is another phone you can't do nothin is just a basic phone is a good phone for old people they will understand it more logo so you want to go phone the note 3 does everything you want and more do nothing wrong with it set one thing the flip letters are in there but the phone is the best
Note 3 you just made better the only thing the Nexus they get software first nothing else
