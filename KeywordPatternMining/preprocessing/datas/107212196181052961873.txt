I've been mulling over putting PA on both of my nexuses again, just haven't had time to lately. And admittedly, I'm curious to see what 4.4 might bring next week. Love the PA rom though.
Halo is kind of cool. I miss the extended desktop/pie mode on my N4. That extra screen real estate was awesome. Google should absolutely build that into the stock ROM. It's worth stealing.
The rates are only slashed for data only packages. The extra data on phone plans is welcome though. Roam has been really quite good the past two weeks for me. I've just activated on days I've been going places, and it's been flawless. Much easier than trying to find a sim and plan once I'm state-side.
