#delete5 hmmm. I like how you catch the falling snow, but conversely the snow collecting on the tractor seems too bright.
#delete Hmmm. The bee is nice and sharp and I love his pollen baskets. But it's little details--like see the white edge in the upper left corner, and the edge of flower in the lower right corner, and the spikes of flowers on the right edge leading out of the picture. Without those included in the background, it would seem less busy and set off that buzzy bee better.
#delete4 Close for me, but I do wish the sky was not quite as bright. This same shot in more of a golden light would be quite beautiful, especially highlighting the dome. It just feels a little grey and cold, despite the brightness around the dome.
#save9 cool poise/pose, especially with that curling leaf as the jump off point. I like the colors and glints in the wings too.
