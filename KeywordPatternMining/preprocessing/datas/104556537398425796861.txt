There's audio problems. I think someone needs to turn their speakers down or use headphones
+ Sony Is it possible to pair the QX lenses with a flash?
+ Sony Can you use QX lenses for video recording like the RX? Is there a microphone?
+ Thomas Fox that was a bit of an assholey thing to say
I think the issue might be at Sony guys end, as her voice seems to be echoing through his speakers
+ Roman Ruiz hangouts normally doesn't send your own voice through your own speakers. Either way, one of them needs to turn their speakers down ☺
How long does it take for the image file to transfer to the phone after taking an image?
It was a good Hangout though. Thanks for doing it I'm super interested in the QX lenses. Kind of hard to choose between the 10 and 100 though. I think Sony dude's (sorry, missed his name) idea about using your mobile LED as a light source was quite amusing. It's not a real alternative in most situations. Perhaps if these sell really well we'll eventually see a Smart Flash accessory
