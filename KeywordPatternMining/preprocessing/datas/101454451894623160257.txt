It's actually more likely that it's not been shipped. Not saying that they don't screw up its just more common that it's the shipper that didn't ship it and blaming royal mail for their screw up
Also if you don't give reviews then they can't be shown... If you give reviews what do you expect them to be used for?
It's Symbian so may be do able. Best get googling. Start with some sort of file explorer
Once you have found the files you should be able to Bluetooth or email them
might be worth a try. I had a k750i and seem to remember there was a usb cable and some management software on the pc that would sync contacts etc. i cant find the software on the sony site and im betting you dont have the usb lead
sorry i assumed you had the k750 in your hand nice response from Sony tho. Good to see they are watching... wish + Three UK would follow that lead!
oh yes... i want a buggy OS with last years tech that costs twice as much as anything else that apple ensure i never really "own" yeh...
nope its been fine for me... oh wait... sorry i got mixed up between jellybean and ios7... they are the same thing right? <sarcasm>

have you noticed the uk play store has changed from "out of stock" to "coming soon" on the nexus 4?
+ Mark Rich 350USD is the same price as the nexus 4 was when it was released hence the suggestion that in the UK it will be the same price as the nexus4 was... 280ukp
when i had a work phone it used to get forwarded to my personal number then switched off and left in the glove box of the van... and stayed that way for close to a year.
If it is it is a really early build of software. It has very few of the kit Kat features we have seen in leaks recently
something else has been spotted... no messenger app only hangouts. which further supports that rumour
The nexus4 was $299 for the 8gb and $349 for the 16gb right? So by my maths the nexus 5 should be £240 for the 16gb and somewhere around the £320 ?
The nexus4 was only on a few networks in the UK and grossly over priced
in the USA i think the 8gb n4 is the same price as the n5 16gb will be hence my prediction earlier in the thread of 240/320
