Gordon, How does the gx7 evf ergonomics compare to the evf in your g3? This question has been bugging me ever since I had a chance to handle the gx7 a few weeks ago. The gx7 viewfinder seemed smaller and cramped. But maybe it was just the rushed environment. I'd appreciate any comments you have on this. Thanks.
Thanks + Gordon Laing , I did not realize it is 16:9 and that explains much, including the evf low profile. Compromises have to be made, I suppose, for that svelte shape.
