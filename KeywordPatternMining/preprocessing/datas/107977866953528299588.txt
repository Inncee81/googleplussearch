+ Mitch Gersbach lol Westpac are terrible with anything Android. Worst bank in Australia when it comes to tech.
Westpac's Android app is a terrible port of the iOS app - it doesn't follow any Android design rules and took forever to actually launch. The Android tablet app is freaking horrible!!!
+ Mitch Gersbach Lol I see what I wrote, what I meant, was it took Westpac forever to actually release the Android app. It launches quickly but yeah - Westpac's subsiduary banks St Georges etc all recieve apps faster and are usually better to use as well. I guess as a long term customer I am just sick of them, so have moved to Commonwealth and ING in the last 2 months! And never been happier!!
