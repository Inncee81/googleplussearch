I liked Ubuntu once but it's short upgrade cycle quickly left my older hardware computers on two occasions in the dust. Where is the old mandate about backwards compatibility? My current older laptop sporting an Intel Centrino motherboard which does not have PAE capability has me back with Slackware 14 as they have two separate kernel stream bases one of which supports non PAE motherboards. Which in my case is problematic because I am much to busy with other things to relearn how to compile everything from source code with changes in GNU compiler tools and needed libraries. I am for the fourth time at the hardware divide.
If that had happened with Old Bushmills near Dublin St. Patrick would never have gotten the snakes to leave.
