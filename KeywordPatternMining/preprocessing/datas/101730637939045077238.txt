Even if I have an Apple running Macintosh? It's a P(ersonal) C(omputer) too.
The laptop I had before my MacBook Pro was an HP. It was decent, but somehow managed to get dust and other stuff in the sealed area between the screen and the protective cover.
+ Miguel Capistran there are fewer things to worry about when using any Apple that runs Macintosh.
One of the main issues that I have when it comes to any PC that runs Windows is all the bloatware that comes on them.
