+ Daniel Sauder : The pilot episode compared the NEX and OMD cameras:
+ Peter Adams : When I referred to "medium format photographers" who love the RX1 I was thinking of you.
+ Dalibor Mrkic , you won't have to wait long!
+ George Maciver . We had a glitch in the encoding and had to take it down. Hopefully RSN (Real Soon Now).
You weren't supposed to watching us record that show, + Rohith Thumati . (Just kidding.) Not sure about the X100S. It certainly was fine when it got to me.
Excellent, + Dennis Morassut . Yes, we very much appreciate your detailed comments. That's one of the great things about the TWiP/AAtG community. When you only have a camera for a few days or a week, there's no way to get to know everything about it. Nor is it possible to relate it to every other model in the manufacturer's product line. (5 NEX bodies? You really HAVE gone off the deep end. So keep those corrections and comments coming!
+ Brian Matiash (and all): Here's the official YouTube playlist for All About the Gear: . The first episode was our pilot. #2 is the Leica show. #3 is the Fuji X100S show, which is about to be published. More to come, roughly one show every two weeks. And we DO want your requests and suggestions. (Thanks + Edward Bartel .)
Thanks, + Gordon Laing . Great job, as always! Our review of the GX7 for #AllAboutTheGear is ready to go. We're just waiting for + Frederick Van Johnson to get his camera so we can show it in the video.
Love this composition, + Gordon Laing .
