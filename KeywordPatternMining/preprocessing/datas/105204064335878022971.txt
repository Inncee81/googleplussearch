+ Richard Langdon they also don't talk about the Optimus elite that still runs 2.3 and still sold in stores
You can't compare phones that were released after the others. Of course they are running less beefy specs . especially how quickly new phones come out. Obviously Samsung is a well liked device because of their specs. If you don't like a phone DON'T BUY IT that simple
