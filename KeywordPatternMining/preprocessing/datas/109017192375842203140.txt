I'm pretty sure the the auto brightness adjustment is related to an Apple patent. Hence why the U.S. devices don't have it but the international devices do. Agreed on the volume button. As soon as I saw the first press images I thought, "why on earth did they move them back up?" That was opne of my favorite adjustments they made going from the 1 to the 2. That's disappointing to hear about the speaker. I was so glad they moved it to the bottom, but if it's worse quality, than it really doesn't matter. I'm also disappointed to hear battery life isn't much improved. The S800 was supposed to provide significantly better battery life. Although I'd be interested to see what battery life is like when Play services isn't having issues.
