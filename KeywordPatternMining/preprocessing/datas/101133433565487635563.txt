That's cheap, would make a good backup fone for me
Note 3 will be my daily driver and I'm not one of those stock vs skinned people
Regardless of what price it is I will still buy it anyway.
I carry 2 fones with me all the time. Â£300 is hardly expensive considering the note 3 will cost me double that when I get it. Besides if I want something and can but it I will.
I've always carried 2 fones one has a giffgaff sim inside I just use that for downloading stuff sort of like my play fone which the nexus 5 will be, replacing my nexus s. The note 3 will be my main fone for family, friends, work etc that will replace my note 2
This is why I will only buy my fones sim free, o2 will probably be the last to update as usual
No spen so it can't be called a note
One of my all time favourite shows along with the six million dollar man
