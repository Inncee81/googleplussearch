A7/A7r comments: - Mode dial, meh. - Nobody's going to customize C3, it has a scary trash can icon on it :-). - They've gratuitously reversed On/Off positions from the NEX-7 on the ring around the shutter. This will drive me nuts if I get one and keep the -7 as my back-up camera. - There's a thumbwheel on the back, so triple-dial control in M mode might still work okay. - WiFi! - Viewfinder positioned for better nose grease stains on the LCD Can't wait to get the image quality reports. These cameras look exciting!
Please, no, don't let there be a mode dial instead of a NEX7 triple dial control
