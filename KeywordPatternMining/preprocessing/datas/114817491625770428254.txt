+ John Pozadzides One tip I am going to give you. Call your bank and get a PIN code for your credit cards, we don't sign for purchases any more, we use the PIN code instead. It bamboozles some of my foreign friends and can be avoided with a little forward planning. Look forward to meeting you at the Rack n' Tenter, 5 mins from my office!
