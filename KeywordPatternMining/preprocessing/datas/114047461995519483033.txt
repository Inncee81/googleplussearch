Nope, I've had the HTC One, which like this has a complete aluminium case and I usually get better reception than my mates. Incedentally two of them have iPhones. I can't speak for the Max but the HTC One that I have is beutifully built and has the processing power to beat the iPhone to death not only that but the build quality is superb and is more than enough to meet the iPhone and best other high end android phones like Samsung's latest Galaxy.
