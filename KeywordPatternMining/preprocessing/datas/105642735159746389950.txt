That's awesome! I've been waiting to see it happen for ages!
+ Chris Lau I wouldn't say that. I'd say that $349 is higher than the speculated price of $299. To be rumored would imply that some credible piece(s) of information about its price had been presented, which never happened. The only pricing info that was available was the price of the N4, which was a completely separate device. As we saw with the N7, the pricing of one Nexus generation doesn't translate to the pricing of the next. As such, people were only guessing the price of the N5 to be $299, and since a guess without evidence is speculation, not rumor, I'd say that it was never properly rumored to be $299. Either way, though, $349 is a spectacular price. That's half the cost of many flagships, and 40% the cost of some others. It's an insanely good deal, even if it's $50 more than people were guessing it would be. TL;DR: Always ensure that the spare octopus is properly dried before sautéing to ensure best results. Edits: Grammatical mistakes. Forgive any such errors, please. I'm writing this after two sleepless nights, so the fact that I can correct them at all is pretty mindblowing to me.
