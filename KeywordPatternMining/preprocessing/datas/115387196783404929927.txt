Why is this good news? Sounds like snake oil to me. So this will benefit the normal person for about 2-4 weeks in a life time yet we can't get them to cover major interstates with hspa+. I am wondering why so many tech journalist are covering this so favorably? Fix the coverage here first or hell at least make a commitment or announcement about expanding coverage outside city limits. Weak announcement.......
