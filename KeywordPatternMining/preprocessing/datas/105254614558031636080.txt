In another article -- I forgot where I read it, exactly -- Sony Mobile said that the US market is "currently a low priority" for them. They will be focusing on the Asia market and the Europe market. They will just maintain a presence in the USA, but not pushing it. So, the linuxinsider article's tone of "doom and gloom for Sony" is not quite right on the spot. Yeah, Sony might not be beating Samsung and Apple anytime soon in the USA . But seeing the US to be less and less relevant every day, Sony's decision might prove to be a wise one.
