+ Nicolas Gullett As far as point 2, I don't know how easy it really is to buy illegal firearms as I've never really tried to go down this path. I can tell you in the 8th grade I was asked if I'd like to buy an uzi from a classmate. I thought he was full of crap. Sure enough, he had one under his mattress. Don't know if it was full auto or not(or even worked). Looking back I'm an idiot for not telling someone. For reference this is in Mesquite, TX. When I was in highschool my friends and I were nerds. All it took was driving to the right part of town and we could score some marijuana, coke, booze, or other illegal items. Realistically now that I'm older I'd have no idea where to start, but looking back at the connections I made back in highschool, I'm really surprised at how well we networked.
