Lol that is why my business card says "Feline Servant" on it.
I do have a couple of cats though that greet me at the door and are extra attentive when I am feeling down or sick. Nothing like my dog though.
#walmart is the biggest offender. On top of this they also end up with their employees paycheck because they can't afford to shop anywhere else. Effing evil I say.
