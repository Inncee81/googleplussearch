I believe the core benefit of Android to Google is the data collection. They could care less what manufacturer does what. When Samsung was looking at Tinzen, then yes, that was a threat as samsung seemed to have the marketing on their side. Samsung v. Apple, Samsung Phones etc. Personally I have a Galaxy Nexus to this day. I just think Samsung pushes faster hardware to keep up with bloat and poor coding (Touchwhiz complaints). I will stick with Nexus units for the time being, but if I deviate, I am pretty sure the Xperia from Sony are my favorite.
