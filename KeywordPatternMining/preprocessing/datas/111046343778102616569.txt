I would buy a bunch and throw them at a stone wall. Smartwatches or glasses can never become a hit. The smartphone era is coming to an end.
+ Ishan Jain yes. We have to stop this madness and make some serious and more contemporary smart technology. Four months and the new smartphone is old as dirt. What can we demand of our new fun toys and the makers? My smartphone is already old and obsolete. A couple of years ago we hunted for faster CPU's on our desktop computers. Now we don't care and the megahertz hysteria stalled. Same thing with mobile displays aka "retina", and smart companion gadgets will stall. At what grade of tech I do not know.
I think that Google Glass will become more of a ordinary product than the old classic watch and what smartwatches will be. I have the Sony Smartwatch, well - not that smart. I rather use something that is, no pun intended, handsfree. There will be a couple of smart-classes - watches, glasses, training bracelets and maybe smartplugs as earphones. The technology must be easy to use or it ends in the almighty box of dusty things. 1. Must be really easy to sync. 2. Super easy charging. No special docks (Samsung Galaxy Gear). 3. Battery time that makes you want to use the smart-thingy and not be afraid of a middle of the day charging extravaganza.
