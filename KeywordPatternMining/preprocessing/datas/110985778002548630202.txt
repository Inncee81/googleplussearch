+ Robert SÃ¸rensen the point was there was no proof that it is a Nexus 5 yet pretty much the entire internet had adopted the name Nexus 5. I applaud + Android Police for not calling it that until confirmed. I'll be laughing if the Nexus 5 on the Play store is just Google trolling us and it ends up releasing as the Nexus 4 (2013)
I hope this offers an out of the box way to send and receive sms via chrome just as the hangouts extension does!
