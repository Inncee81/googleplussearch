Really? Their android app works great. Absolutely flawlessly and looks great on anything except a tablet. Annoyingly they have an ipad app but no android tablet optimisation. I think they were one of the first banks in the world to release a windows 8 app and I'm pretty sure they're the only bank in Australia to have one. The windows app is freaking awesome. They've talked about mobile contactless payments in the past but haven't heard anything in a while.
+ James Bryant what? Looks great, works flawlessly. Try another internet connection maybe
+ James Bryant yeah they were so very slow I remember now. Really annoying. I'm happy to put up with a bit from them because I've found their customer service impeccable. I dealt with nab for work and a personal credit card and they were fucking ridiculous bad in comparison. Made me wait for days on hold only to screw me around transferring me from one department to the next. I decided then to never leave Westpac. You call and get through quickly and if they need to transfer you they'll hold the line with you and hand you over.
Dammit I just ordered a rip off dock.. Would have much preferred this
