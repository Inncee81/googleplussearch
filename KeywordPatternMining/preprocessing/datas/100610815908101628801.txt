No RAW... So it won't be useful as a backup camera solution. Have to stick to a normal compact. Shame. + Mike Spinak - Wex website listing states that Playmemories app allows control of aperture and exposure for the QX100
I guess the controls - such as they are - are found on the smartphone via the app. My other problem is the ergonomics: taking photos with a smartphone or even many compacts can be shaky as there less to really get hold of to keep it steady.
Right, + Donald Farmer ! (I'd still like to try one, though)
Super shot. Rim lighting on the figure is lovely and defines it well from the background. I'll be interested in snap-on cameras when they develop a bit further, especially to do RAW.
