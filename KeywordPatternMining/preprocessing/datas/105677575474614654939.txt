There's been a bit of buzz about Sony's rumored Alpha A7 mirrorless camera models, and finally, the company revealed early on Wednesday what photography fans have been waiting for: its α7 and α7R digital cameras. It also surprised with a new RX10 zoom camera to its Cyber-shot line. Sony claims its new mirrorless models, the Alpha 7 (pictured above) and Alpha 7R (for advanced photographers and professionals), are the world's smallest full-frame interchangeable-lens cameras.

Both are made of magnesium alloy and built to withstand dust, moisture and tough weather conditions. Sony Alpha 7 “With these new α7 camera systems, Sony has completely redefined the look and feel of a professional-grade digital camera,” Mike Kahn, director of the interchangeable lens camera business at Sony Electronics, said in a statement. “The α7 and α7R cameras are significantly smaller, lighter and more portable than any other full-frame interchange lens camera yet deliver image quality, power and performance that professionals and enthusiasts crave.” The α7R model packs a 36.4-megapixel 35mm Exmor CMOS sensor, which is the highest resolution sensor in the Alpha lineup, and no optical low-pass filter. This aims to reduce picture noise and keep images clear. Sony Alpha 7R Meanwhile, the Alpha 7 version has a 24.3-megapixel full-frame Exmor CMOS sensor, as well as a Fast Hybrid AF system that combines phase- and contrast-detect AF methods for quickly zeroing in on a target. It can shoot at up to five frames per second continuously with non-stop AF tracking, so users can capture moving objects without blurring the image. Not surprisingly, the cameras are costly. The α7R camera will be priced at $2,300 for body only. The Alpha 7 will be offered with a 28-70mm f3.5–f5.6 full-frame lens (model SEL2870) for about $2,000 and available for body-only for $1,700. Both cameras will be available in December. RX10 Sony RX10 Sony also introduced a new product to its RX family. The RX10 comes with a 20.2 "effective" megapixel back-illuminated CMOS sensor and a 24-200mm (35mm equivalent) F2.8 Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T zoom lens. It takes both stills and full HD videos. Just like the Alpha models, the RX10 features a BIONZ X processing engine and AF system. It will cost about $1,300 and go on sale in November. Lenses and Accessories Sony added five new full-frame e-mount lenses to its collection too, including mid-range zoom lenses from Sony and Carl Zeiss, two Zeiss Sonnar T TM prime lenses and a G LensTM telephoto zoom. Its interchangeable lens lineup now offers 21 different lenses.
