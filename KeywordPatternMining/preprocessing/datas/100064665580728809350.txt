Tell me about it Kyle, there's no way a Sgs2 wvga screen looks better than a HD one.
I have just upgraded to the Xperia Z1 (previoiusly owned HTC One X) I hope Sony are prompt with their FW updates and that 4.3 (then 4.4) is not too far away for my new Z1
Are you going to enable some of the game data to be saved onto the micro sd card, as some games are over 3 Gb ie BardsTale

Hopefully Vodafone will release it soon, improving the battery life and updating the camera. Nice one Sony
Omg, terrible resolution and only 8gb. I can't imagine many kids double digit age wise ie 10 upwards being impressed either. I imagine much more value for money for an extra £30 ie the Asus memo HD pad. It would wipe the floor with this.
Another Xperia Z1 owner here, I'm happy with my handset choice
If the leaked specifications are spot on and the prices translate as above, then it will certainly be a very big hit for people who have the opportunity to buy a top spec android phone sim free. I don't have £399 spare, so I got a Xperia Z1 on an upgrade last week.
