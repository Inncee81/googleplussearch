Sony push the envelope yet again - A7, A7r and RX10 announcements If you are looking for something new and innovative and big major multiple gear announcements then Sony usually don't disappoint. They seem to delight in making the improbab...
Fuji X-E2 - Another bits and pieces update or something more? - Thoughts on the X-E1 in use. Fuji X-E2 announced today. No headline grabbing updates, so is this another example of a new model just because its time to bring one out? In this case maybe not. There's supposed to be faster AF, which addresses something that Fuji X cameras are not great ...

More thoughts on the Sony A7 / A7r More thoughts on the new Sony. This was in reply to a comment on a Google+ forum and I thought I'd publish it here. Comment. ASP-C ILCs will feel the squeeze at the top end.﻿ My reply Soundimageplus Yesterday 22:51 Well maybe. But I think we have to ...
Well maybe. But I think we have to see what lenses emerge. Fast (ish) zooms are relatively big for the Fuji system and lenses like the 18-200mm zoom for NEX are huge. The new Sony can get away with some relatively small fast primes, but at the telephoto end, where of course you don't get the benefit of the smaller sensor, the lenses are likely to be huge. Then there is the cost. People buy the best camera system they can afford within the budget they have allocated for that. A relatively small decent system for the Sony is probably going to be £3000+ if you want the 36MP model. You can get a lot of NEX, Fuji X or m4/3 for that kind of money, plus access to more extensive lens systems. There will I'm sure be an enthusiastic group of early adopters who will make a lot of noise on the forums etc. but this is a camera system that has little appeal for the snapshooter, the occasional photographer or even the aspiring enthusiast. Its just too expensive. Others who are already committed to other systems may also hesitate to move to this because as ever, its going to take years to get a decent lens range in place and few people are prepared to go the adapter route for either a-mount lenses (again big, heavy and expensive) or MF lenses from other manufacturers. The price is reasonable though not particularly attractive and at least its less than the ridiculously overpriced RX1, which will now probably nose dive in terms of S/H value which should please the people who bought it (NOT!) It strikes me as more of a "Look what we can do' exercise from Sony and a pointer to the future. I think the main problem is what they do with their other systems. Where does this leave their DSLT's, the NEX system and as I mentioned before the RX1's? Sony seem to a certain extent to use a scattergun approach slinging this stuff out and checking later to see if they have hit anything. Personally, I think the more important camera they release tomorrow is the RX100 type 1" sensor camera with the equivalent of a 24-200mm f/2.8 lens. Now that should be something to see.

Continuing Yin and Yang with the Fuji X sensor. Sometimes I think the images from my X-E1 are amongst the best I've ever seen, sometimes, if they happen to contain a lot of smeared similar looking green foliage, I wonder why on earth I bought it. However, spending the last few days in a heavy editing cyc...
Editing, Editing, Editing!!! Cold and wet outside for the past few days, so I've been in front of my monitor editing, captioning, keywording and uploading to my stock libraries. My backlog is now huge, made even larger by the wonderful summer we had. Some of the above is from last summ...
