nice video of a tough challenge! I like the winner, but I also like the lit pepper... Thanx again!
Thanx for your words Blunty! I took the picture of the icecream late in the evening, the icecream was my dessert actualy... I just a polaraizing filter to get the nice colours and put the ice high in the gutter of the porch to get the upwards angel. Thanx again also to everybody for their reactions!
Thanx, but I thought it was the snail or the dog that would win. I really thought mine was a bit to simple...
I'm sorry my picture didn't meet the requirements, I guess I did miss that part. But It was fun to see it in the video! Thanx!!!
I like the challenge... Now I only have to find a second camera. ;-)
I'll think of something...
