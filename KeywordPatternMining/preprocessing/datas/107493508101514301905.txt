#save7 This is really interesting at giant size.
#delete4 Only becauseof DOF too shallow for my taste. there is so much more great detail in the petals... I see no crêpes here. I like crêpes. + Clement Biger
Oops. Nevermind. Sorry about that. Didn't realize the save numbers are out of sequence.
#delete2 A faster shutter speed could freeze the bee's wings. I think that you could pull more color from the bee. The background is very busy and makes it a bit hard to focus on the bee.
#delete5 Dead light on the building. Keystoning. Too tight crop on bottom and sides. Sky isn't bright enough or it's not detailed enough. Color is flat. The flare could be nice, but if it's not adding color or lens reflections or light rays, it's not.
#delete3 Overlit, centered with no action implied, low but not heroic angle, grubby grass, dead feeling sky.
Much better than you speak German, + Max Kotchouro !
Wild! It looks like the rock is melting and flowing down the foreground cliff.
I also really like the contrast and the glisten of the foreground rock.
