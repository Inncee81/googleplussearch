What app did you download in the lower left, it looks cool! That is funny.
The headline is wrong. They just dropped the price. It's not zero by any means.

I am more excited about the possibility of a Google watch than I am about the Nexus 5.
What watch is it , cost and screen size ?
I like the Hot Watch due to it having most features including phone calls. Although I would not use the phone call feature a lot I would have it if I needed it. However, I am wanting one soon and may have to settle for the Sony 2.
