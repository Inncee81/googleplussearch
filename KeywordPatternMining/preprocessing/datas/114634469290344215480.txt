Very interesting indeed. I'm shooting the 5D III and own around 12 L-lenses and I'v been considering the OMD EM-1 for some time but I'm sure I would miss the full-frame sensor. This sounds like a great camera for landscape and portrait shooters but the limited fps is a killer for sports. Before I saw the specs I was expecting 10 fps, at least for the A7 with its 24mp. I really wonder why Sony couldn't come up with a faster frame rate. This could have become THE camera for next year's Soccer World Cup in Brazil but no pro-sports photog will shoot at 5fps. Maybe this could get fixed in a firmware update but for me, it's a downer...
+ Gordon Laing I just found this on: "THE SHUTTER SOUND IS LOUD and CLUNKY. If you want silent, this is not the camera to go for. Will elaborate more on this soon as well as show a video of the camera and shutter sound." Can you confirm that? It's hard to believe a mirror-lens camera to be that noisy...
+ Marcus Schommler thanks for the link to that youtube video. That shutter sounds indeed really loud - you can hear it at around 08:20 in the video posted above. Can anybody explain why a mirror-less camera has such a loud shutter noise? I hope this can be fixed in software as it seems to be quite an interesting camera for street-photographers otherwise.
+ Allen Corlett thanks for the clarification.
