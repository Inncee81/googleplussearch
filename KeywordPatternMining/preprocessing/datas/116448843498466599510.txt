Awesome! I have a photo of my brother and I playing Missle Command, but the camera is aimed at us, not the TV!
Not just "state of the art" at that time, + Frederick Van Johnson , it was the ONLY art!
Looking forward to your review, and hoping you say that its not worth the upgrade from the S110 since I just bought one!
Hey, I would drive up from Indy for that, but depending on the date I may be in Orlando.
