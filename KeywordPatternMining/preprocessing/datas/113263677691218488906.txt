As it turns out Mr. James Allison(ex constructor of Lotus) started working with the team(Ferrari) much earlier than planned(1st of September). They have new elements - newly shaped exhaust system and a new floor. Rumours going around for a new RW too. They have been also planned changes to better fuel consumption, work with the burned gasses and the suspension. Supposed they would have a new FRIC system for Spa too.
