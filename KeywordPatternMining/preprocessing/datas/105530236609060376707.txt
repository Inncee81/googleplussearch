I have the TYLT charger and I love it. It can charge my N4 and if I lay my N7 on it's side it will charge it too. Qi charging is the way to go.
Only one thing I've noticed that bothers me a little bit, the back of the phone gets really hot on the TYLT. Not sure why other than the fact it's the charger taking a long time to charge. Plus I think its the charger heating and not my phone.
+ Karl Collard and + Humberto Gauna I use the TYLT for both my Nexus4 and Nexus7. The Nexus7 has to be turned on it's side to charge.
