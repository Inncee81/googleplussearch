I am also glad to hear that + Joel Karlsson made it home.... And seeing as he met up with + Nunzio Prenna we can forget about the #haveyouseentheitaliansgear hashtag as well
+ Gerard Charnley that's fine, we'll be there 6.45 or so.
I have only just ventured into this myself and obviously there is a concern about support/continuity if you're going to use this for your business but here is a thought; build a hackintosh. Basically you select compatible 'pc' components to build a machine that does what you want and simply run OSX on it. If you don't like tinkering with machines this may not be for you and as I said, there is a potential support question but it may be an idea worth entertaining. The upside is of course you can pretty much build to your own specs (and expand/upgrade later if needed) and still run the OS you are familiar with without having to wait for apple to come up with the new Pro.
Heh, I'm just about to move in the other direction ;)
Well... It's not so much Apple I'm switching into as it is OSX I'm not a fan of the Apple hardware pricing but the few weeks I've been testing OSX now have been an absolute eye opener and I'm exploring ways to get my main machine OSX'd. As your blogpost indicates... you need a tool to do the work, and if one tool fits your needs better than another you would be a fool to not use it just because the sticker on the back isn't the same as on your other tools.
I'd say my 550 produces this much noise at 800 ISO with a 1/1000 exposure time so this looks very promising indeed!
