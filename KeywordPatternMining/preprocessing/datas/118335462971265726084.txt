I just think its funny how people are using the part of the game where Rock Star is trying to get you to by in game cash witch you can't do because it's not working (turned off my RStar ) Rock Star also said that the mico translations would not give any player a advantage for having more money then a nother player and all the car glitch does is give you money So all they can do is fix it and move on lesson learned
