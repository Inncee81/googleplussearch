handsome as ever!
+ George Maciver maybe we need to be asking ourselves what are we posting online? Do you really need to post embarrassing photos of your friends? That's not really a great thing to do anyway so it goes back to "just because we can do something doesn't mean we should". + Paul Griffiths you post on your blog (what is IFTTT?) and share on facebook? Not sure, seems a grey area
