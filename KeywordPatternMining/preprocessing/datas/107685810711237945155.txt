+ Antonio Horn Of course their phones are bad.. there's way too big of competitors.. and all they have to show is "waterproof" phones... great. But Sony is dominating when it comes to media and other hardware. Playstation is HUGE, but so is Sony Media Pictures. The Walking Dead, Spiderman-- Just name a couple movies off the top of your head that came out this year and near half will most likely be Sony-owned.
+ Antonio Horn They don't. But a fusion would mean great things for both. Nintendo's creativity with Playstation's power. I'm all for that. But as of right now.. they don't need to. Microsoft's not strong enough to overpower Japanese markets.. especially globally. Nintendo and Sony are fine where they are.
