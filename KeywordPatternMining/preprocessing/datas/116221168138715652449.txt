Are those headphones the ZX-600's?
No I haven't tried them + Azry Jawi but I have heard good things about them. I have a pair of Phillips Downtown which are my main pair for when I'm at home. I use my Sony ZX600's for when I'm out and about. It should probably be the other way around as the Phillips pair has a mic and a remote button.
I think people are considering how much it costs to get the inferior version that by the time you fork out that much you might as well get the better of the two.
