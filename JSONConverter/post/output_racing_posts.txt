{"userName": "Vincent Uribe", "sentiment_emotions": [], "hashtags": [], "userID": "107704850988074413781", "content": "Omaha Beach Trail August 18, 2013 Suddenly I open my eyes. It\u2019s 6:45 am, and slowly I am becoming aware of the alarm clock. Today is the big day, time to get up. As I am going upstairs, I see Camille, my friend who invited me here, in Normandy. Today is the day we run our first trail. We sit in the kitchen, being careful not to wake up his children, although they won\u2019t stay asleep for long anyway. Camille tells me he got nightmares about the run, he\u2019s stressed but it will be ok, it is not his first run nor it is mine, just the conditions are different. We eat without appetite, but we know we\u2019ll need the energy for later. It is 7am and the start isn\u2019t for another three hours, but there is a lot to do. I finish my breakfast, some cereals and some orange juice. After a quick shower, it is time to get ready. Each one of us pins his bib over his shirt, doing our best to get it right the first time. Even our shirts have a special meaning\u2026 It is the same I wore for the marathon, my last race. Before putting the shirt I stretch myself, especially my IT band, as I know it is likely to get painful later. I fill up my camelback, just two liters of water. I think it will be enough, I ran further with a lot less. I\u2019m nervous now, it is 9am and I feel the race coming, I start imagining it, the runners, the pushing, the speed\u2026 There is time yet, I have to focus on another thing, anything. I put my GoPro camera around my torso, right upside the bib. Then I put the camelback and check that nothing is moving. I need this to be as much as part of my body as possible. Last but not least, I put on my VFF. There are not the right shoes for this race, I know it. We did a short run two days earlier to take a look at a small portion of the course. During this run I got to see how slippery the course is, going uphill and downhill rapidly, mixing road and dirt, and how inappropriate my shoes are. I know big rocks are going to be an issues, but I got a plan, if I\u2019m fast enough I can fly over them, I just have to trust my body into doing it. I can\u2019t do it if I\u2019m looking at my feet, worrying about the pain. 9:20am, time to go, we are ready. We get out of the house and head to the starting line, a few hundred meters away. There are a lot of runners out there. Most of them look impressive, with their gear and their way to jog along the sidewalk. Nobody is smiling, I tell Camille that. The ambient is tense, with the grey sky promising us some rain later on, and all these serious faces around us, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m here to run a race and have fun. I know I won\u2019t be the first one to arrive, although the week before I imagined it, even hoped it. I have seen the map and I did a run, but I have no idea what to expect. It is a trail, not my usual kind of race. I run on road, I race in cities, where everything is flat. We are both at the starting line; we will start in a few minutes. The camera is ready, my watch is ready too. We are almost in front of the pack, my favorite spot. Here there is almost no pushing, and I will be able to break from the pack soon enough to set my pace. \u201cDon\u2019t try to follow them\u201d I told Camille, \u201cThey are going to start faster than you and you will get tired, just go at your own pace\u201d. It is almost 10am, everybody is silent. The signal is given, and off we go, everybody clicking on their watches. We go fast, I\u2019ve already lost my friend but it is ok, we both knew we wouldn\u2019t do the race together, I\u2019ll see him at the finish. I am going to fast, so I check my watch: 15.6 kph. We are running on the beach, on an unequal terrain, but fairly solid so it is ok. A girl in a pink shirt passes me by and stays a little ahead, so I decide to stay with her, she looks strong and I set my pace on her, there is time to pass her later. I feel strangely alone out there, without music, running along the beach. I make sure I am following the others, as they will try to avoid the dry sand, which is much more difficult to run on. I check my watch again: 14kph, I am slowing down. I try to stabilize my speed, but I don\u2019t try to go faster, a big hill is coming and I will need all my strength. By the end of the beach, we jump up a few rocks and go back to the road, leading to the hill. The hill is straight for around 1000 meters, going from almost sea level to a 45 meters altitude. I am running it, slow and steady, passing some runners who preferred to walk it. We go through a gate opening over a campground, which I barely see before we enter a field. By my side is some runner in red short, running with a small bottle of water in each hand. I stay with him and start to talk. \u201cWhy nobody is talking?\u201d I ask him, \u201cYou talk because you are in good shape\u201d he answers. His name is Rachid, and I keep running by his side, finding his company enjoyable. We run together, passing each other when there is no space to be side-by-side. The view from up here is amazing. The sky is blue now, seems like it won\u2019t rain after all. I can see the sea from here, but the cliffs are more impressive. I never saw anything like that before. At kilometer 6 I pass the aid point. I don\u2019t stop, just grabbing some orange quarters and keep on running. I am still fresh and my legs want to run, I feel it. I\u2019ve lost Rachid at the aid point, so I carry on alone. Soon I am with Samuel, another runner and an osteopath from Le Havres. We start talking and by kilometer 7, the course starts going downhill, back to seaside. I know where we are as I ran here with Camille. People around the course are awfully quiet. I don\u2019t know if it is a culture thing or what, but it is starting to annoy me, so when we pass by a group of people, I start cheering them, and they cheer us back! Finally, that is the kind of thing I like when racing. Rachid is back and with Samuel we are now running by the seaside. The course is flat here so we can speed up a little. They are following me, chatting with each other. As I go off road, I know what is coming\u2026 Some wood stairs going up the hill. As they are here since WWII, they are not straight and the rain last night made them slippery. The runners in front of me are nowhere to be found, so I start running up the stairs, walking where the trees are too low to fly by. I look back once my feet on the last step, but nobody is behind me, they are walking the stairs. I start again, looking at the sea while I\u2019m running. The course is all grass here, until the stairs going down. The descent is stiff so I\u2019m going slowly, and Rachid and Samuel are right behind me. We get back on the road but not for long, in front of us is the entry of the forest. We go straight there and soon the trees are hiding the sun. As the air is getting colder I become aware of how hot my body feels. I know this is the time to cool down, so when the course is going stiffly uphill again, I run it slow and steady, like before. A photographer is hiding in there, and takes picture of every runner as they go by him. \u201cYou did not take me at my best\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s the point!\u201d the young woman next to him says. As I keep running, I realize she was wearing a skirt I start wondering how she got here\u2026 The course goes forth and back from fields to forest, with little chunk of road in between. I am around kilometer 14 now and my feet are sore. I stepped on a few rocks, but my feet have to adapt quickly to the changing terrain, which is the hardest. Down the road I see a racer limping. \u201cStretch it then go on\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s my knee, it\u2019s ok\u201d he answers. By kilometer 16 my world resumes itself by going up and down, but it is getting better, it is now almost flat. I run fast, but I keep my energy too, managing the effort. There is still 10 kilometers to go, with a few on the beach. These will be hard, I know it. \u00a0 Every race has a surprise. This moment you could not anticipate and when you try to get the best of it. My surprise started at kilometer 18 and finished by kilometer 22. France is mostly flat. Mountains are on the frontiers and I never got the chance to go there. Maybe that is why those hills looked like mountains to me. As I reach a group of runners in front of me, I see they are walking up the hill, most of them using their hands on their knees to keep going. I get in line with them and start climbing. These hill are not very tall, but once you are up there, you have to get down the other side, and with minimalist footwear, going down is often a problem. Indeed, in the wet grass my shoes have no adherence and I often slip off. Staying up is a real effort here and I know that I am in the way of the runners behind me. \u201cGo left then right\u201d I heard coming from behind me. I try to do it but it does not matter, I can\u2019t keep my balance so I lean forward and start speeding up. I just managed to get down the hill that up I go again. I can see the floor changing below my feet, going from dirt and grass to roots. My feelings are somewhat mixed. I\u2019m enjoying the race, but this part of the course is getting harder by the meter, I feel like jumping to avoid all the rocks and roots, while trying to keep my balance as the terrain is going up and down. Good thing I am too focused to think, I just want to get out of there to some road. \u201c3 or 4 kilometers left\u201d some volunteer says on the last hill. Some runners would have preferred to know if it was 3 or 4, so I check my watch. Four kilometers to go. The course goes down and I can see the last aid point. I stop there the time to eat two quarters of an orange. As I\u2019m off again, I feel how tired I am. My back hurts, my feet hurt, my legs hurt. I try to forget the pain but it won\u2019t go away. I continue, the finish line can\u2019t be far. Soon I get on an asphalt portion of the course and I feel so relieved that I start speeding up. There are more people here, cheering, making me realize how empty the woods were. The course is still going up and down but now I\u2019m running on soft dry sand, doing my best not to slow down, without much success I must say. \u201cGo right, there are stairs near the young boy\u201d somebody tells me. I see the boy and go toward him but this is not the way, I have to go right, by the volunteers. I can feel the pain invading my body like some kind of decease, but I\u2019m stronger. I am a marathoner, I am a runner, I can do it! Right after the stairs is the beach, I know the last kilometers are on the beach, so I must be near. I get to the hard, wet, sand. \u201cIt is almost over\u201d a runner tells me as I pass him by. I speed up, and speed up some more. I pass by another runner who is struggling. \u201cCome on, you can do it\u201d I say, staying by his side. \u201cGo on, I\u2019ve got cramps, it will be ok\u201d he tells me. I can see in his eyes he decided to restrain himself, so I go, and after 2 hours and 36 minutes, finish my first trail.", "replyCount": 3, "cleanContent": "Omaha Beach Trail August 18, 2013 Suddenly I open my eyes. It\u2019s 6:45 am, and slowly I am becoming aware of the alarm clock. Today is the big day, time to get up. As I am going upstairs, I see Camille, my friend who invited me here, in Normandy. Today is the day we run our first trail. We sit in the kitchen, being careful not to wake up his children, although they won\u2019t stay asleep for long anyway. Camille tells me he got nightmares about the run, he\u2019s stressed but it will be ok, it is not his first run nor it is mine, just the conditions are different. We eat without appetite, but we know we\u2019ll need the energy for later. It is 7am and the start isn\u2019t for another three hours, but there is a lot to do. I finish my breakfast, some cereals and some orange juice. After a quick shower, it is time to get ready. Each one of us pins his bib over his shirt, doing our best to get it right the first time. Even our shirts have a special meaning\u2026 It is the same I wore for the marathon, my last race. Before putting the shirt I stretch myself, especially my IT band, as I know it is likely to get painful later. I fill up my camelback, just two liters of water. I think it will be enough, I ran further with a lot less. I\u2019m nervous now, it is 9am and I feel the race coming, I start imagining it, the runners, the pushing, the speed\u2026 There is time yet, I have to focus on another thing, anything. I put my GoPro camera around my torso, right upside the bib. Then I put the camelback and check that nothing is moving. I need this to be as much as part of my body as possible. Last but not least, I put on my VFF. There are not the right shoes for this race, I know it. We did a short run two days earlier to take a look at a small portion of the course. During this run I got to see how slippery the course is, going uphill and downhill rapidly, mixing road and dirt, and how inappropriate my shoes are. I know big rocks are going to be an issues, but I got a plan, if I\u2019m fast enough I can fly over them, I just have to trust my body into doing it. I can\u2019t do it if I\u2019m looking at my feet, worrying about the pain. 9:20am, time to go, we are ready. We get out of the house and head to the starting line, a few hundred meters away. There are a lot of runners out there. Most of them look impressive, with their gear and their way to jog along the sidewalk. Nobody is smiling, I tell Camille that. The ambient is tense, with the grey sky promising us some rain later on, and all these serious faces around us, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m here to run a race and have fun. I know I won\u2019t be the first one to arrive, although the week before I imagined it, even hoped it. I have seen the map and I did a run, but I have no idea what to expect. It is a trail, not my usual kind of race. I run on road, I race in cities, where everything is flat. We are both at the starting line; we will start in a few minutes. The camera is ready, my watch is ready too. We are almost in front of the pack, my favorite spot. Here there is almost no pushing, and I will be able to break from the pack soon enough to set my pace. \u201cDon\u2019t try to follow them\u201d I told Camille, \u201cThey are going to start faster than you and you will get tired, just go at your own pace\u201d. It is almost 10am, everybody is silent. The signal is given, and off we go, everybody clicking on their watches. We go fast, I\u2019ve already lost my friend but it is ok, we both knew we wouldn\u2019t do the race together, I\u2019ll see him at the finish. I am going to fast, so I check my watch: 15.6 kph. We are running on the beach, on an unequal terrain, but fairly solid so it is ok. A girl in a pink shirt passes me by and stays a little ahead, so I decide to stay with her, she looks strong and I set my pace on her, there is time to pass her later. I feel strangely alone out there, without music, running along the beach. I make sure I am following the others, as they will try to avoid the dry sand, which is much more difficult to run on. I check my watch again: 14kph, I am slowing down. I try to stabilize my speed, but I don\u2019t try to go faster, a big hill is coming and I will need all my strength. By the end of the beach, we jump up a few rocks and go back to the road, leading to the hill. The hill is straight for around 1000 meters, going from almost sea level to a 45 meters altitude.

I see the boy and go toward him but this is not the way, I have to go right, by the volunteers. I can feel the pain invading my body like some kind of decease, but I\u2019m stronger. I am a marathoner, I am a runner, I can do it! Right after the stairs is the beach, I know the last kilometers are on the beach, so I must be near. I get to the hard, wet, sand. \u201cIt is almost over\u201d a runner tells me as I pass him by. I speed up, and speed up some more. I pass by another runner who is struggling. \u201cCome on, you can do it\u201d I say, staying by his side. \u201cGo on, I\u2019ve got cramps, it will be ok\u201d he tells me. I can see in his eyes he decided to restrain himself, so I go, and after 2 hours and 36 minutes, finish my first trail.", "replyCount": 3, "cleanContent": "Omaha Beach Trail August 18, 2013 Suddenly I open my eyes. It\u2019s 6:45 am, and slowly I am becoming aware of the alarm clock. Today is the big day, time to get up. As I am going upstairs, I see Camille, my friend who invited me here, in Normandy. Today is the day we run our first trail. We sit in the kitchen, being careful not to wake up his children, although they won\u2019t stay asleep for long anyway. Camille tells me he got nightmares about the run, he\u2019s stressed but it will be ok, it is not his first run nor it is mine, just the conditions are different. We eat without appetite, but we know we\u2019ll need the energy for later. It is 7am and the start isn\u2019t for another three hours, but there is a lot to do. I finish my breakfast, some cereals and some orange juice. After a quick shower, it is time to get ready. Each one of us pins his bib over his shirt, doing our best to get it right the first time. Even our shirts have a special meaning\u2026 It is the same I wore for the marathon, my last race. Before putting the shirt I stretch myself, especially my IT band, as I know it is likely to get painful later. I fill up my camelback, just two liters of water. I think it will be enough, I ran further with a lot less. I\u2019m nervous now, it is 9am and I feel the race coming, I start imagining it, the runners, the pushing, the speed\u2026 There is time yet, I have to focus on another thing, anything. I put my GoPro camera around my torso, right upside the bib. Then I put the camelback and check that nothing is moving. I need this to be as much as part of my body as possible. Last but not least, I put on my VFF. There are not the right shoes for this race, I know it. We did a short run two days earlier to take a look at a small portion of the course. During this run I got to see how slippery the course is, going uphill and downhill rapidly, mixing road and dirt, and how inappropriate my shoes are. I know big rocks are going to be an issues, but I got a plan, if I\u2019m fast enough I can fly over them, I just have to trust my body into doing it. I can\u2019t do it if I\u2019m looking at my feet, worrying about the pain. 9:20am, time to go, we are ready. We get out of the house and head to the starting line, a few hundred meters away. There are a lot of runners out there. Most of them look impressive, with their gear and their way to jog along the sidewalk. Nobody is smiling, I tell Camille that. The ambient is tense, with the grey sky promising us some rain later on, and all these serious faces around us, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m here to run a race and have fun. I know I won\u2019t be the first one to arrive, although the week before I imagined it, even hoped it. I have seen the map and I did a run, but I have no idea what to expect. It is a trail, not my usual kind of race. I run on road, I race in cities, where everything is flat. We are both at the starting line; we will start in a few minutes. The camera is ready, my watch is ready too. We are almost in front of the pack, my favorite spot. Here there is almost no pushing, and I will be able to break from the pack soon enough to set my pace. \u201cDon\u2019t try to follow them\u201d I told Camille, \u201cThey are going to start faster than you and you will get tired, just go at your own pace\u201d. It is almost 10am, everybody is silent. The signal is given, and off we go, everybody clicking on their watches. We go fast, I\u2019ve already lost my friend but it is ok, we both knew we wouldn\u2019t do the race together, I\u2019ll see him at the finish. I am going to fast, so I check my watch: 15.6 kph. We are running on the beach, on an unequal terrain, but fairly solid so it is ok. A girl in a pink shirt passes me by and stays a little ahead, so I decide to stay with her, she looks strong and I set my pace on her, there is time to pass her later. I feel strangely alone out there, without music, running along the beach. I make sure I am following the others, as they will try to avoid the dry sand, which is much more difficult to run on. I check my watch again: 14kph, I am slowing down. I try to stabilize my speed, but I don\u2019t try to go faster, a big hill is coming and I will need all my strength. By the end of the beach, we jump up a few rocks and go back to the road, leading to the hill. The hill is straight for around 1000 meters, going from almost sea level to a 45 meters altitude. I am running it, slow and steady, passing some runners who preferred to walk it. We go through a gate opening over a campground, which I barely see before we enter a field. By my side is some runner in red short, running with a small bottle of water in each hand. I stay with him and start to talk. \u201cWhy nobody is talking?\u201d I ask him, \u201cYou talk because you are in good shape\u201d he answers. His name is Rachid, and I keep running by his side, finding his company enjoyable. We run together, passing each other when there is no space to be side-by-side. The view from up here is amazing. The sky is blue now, seems like it won\u2019t rain after all. I can see the sea from here, but the cliffs are more impressive. I never saw anything like that before. At kilometer 6 I pass the aid point. I don\u2019t stop, just grabbing some orange quarters and keep on running. I am still fresh and my legs want to run, I feel it. I\u2019ve lost Rachid at the aid point, so I carry on alone. Soon I am with Samuel, another runner and an osteopath from Le Havres. We start talking and by kilometer 7, the course starts going downhill, back to seaside. I know where we are as I ran here with Camille. People around the course are awfully quiet. I don\u2019t know if it is a culture thing or what, but it is starting to annoy me, so when we pass by a group of people, I start cheering them, and they cheer us back! Finally, that is the kind of thing I like when racing. Rachid is back and with Samuel we are now running by the seaside. The course is flat here so we can speed up a little. They are following me, chatting with each other. As I go off road, I know what is coming\u2026 Some wood stairs going up the hill. As they are here since WWII, they are not straight and the rain last night made them slippery. The runners in front of me are nowhere to be found, so I start running up the stairs, walking where the trees are too low to fly by. I look back once my feet on the last step, but nobody is behind me, they are walking the stairs. I start again, looking at the sea while I\u2019m running. The course is all grass here, until the stairs going down. The descent is stiff so I\u2019m going slowly, and Rachid and Samuel are right behind me. We get back on the road but not for long, in front of us is the entry of the forest. We go straight there and soon the trees are hiding the sun. As the air is getting colder I become aware of how hot my body feels. I know this is the time to cool down, so when the course is going stiffly uphill again, I run it slow and steady, like before. A photographer is hiding in there, and takes picture of every runner as they go by him. \u201cYou did not take me at my best\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s the point!\u201d the young woman next to him says. As I keep running, I realize she was wearing a skirt I start wondering how she got here\u2026 The course goes forth and back from fields to forest, with little chunk of road in between. I am around kilometer 14 now and my feet are sore. I stepped on a few rocks, but my feet have to adapt quickly to the changing terrain, which is the hardest. Down the road I see a racer limping. \u201cStretch it then go on\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s my knee, it\u2019s ok\u201d he answers. By kilometer 16 my world resumes itself by going up and down, but it is getting better, it is now almost flat. I run fast, but I keep my energy too, managing the effort. There is still 10 kilometers to go, with a few on the beach. These will be hard, I know it. Every race has a surprise. This moment you could not anticipate and when you try to get the best of it. My surprise started at kilometer 18 and finished by kilometer 22. France is mostly flat. Mountains are on the frontiers and I never got the chance to go there. Maybe that is why those hills looked like mountains to me. As I reach a group of runners in front of me, I see they are walking up the hill, most of them using their hands on their knees to keep going. I get in line with them and start climbing. These hill are not very tall, but once you are up there, you have to get down the other side, and with minimalist footwear, going down is often a problem. Indeed, in the wet grass my shoes have no adherence and I often slip off. Staying up is a real effort here and I know that I am in the way of the runners behind me. \u201cGo left then right\u201d I heard coming from behind me. I try to do it but it does not matter, I can\u2019t keep my balance so I lean forward and start speeding up. I just managed to get down the hill that up I go again. I can see the floor changing below my feet, going from dirt and grass to roots. My feelings are somewhat mixed. I\u2019m enjoying the race, but this part of the course is getting harder by the meter, I feel like jumping to avoid all the rocks and roots, while trying to keep my balance as the terrain is going up and down. Good thing I am too focused to think, I just want to get out of there to some road. \u201c3 or 4 kilometers left\u201d some volunteer says on the last hill. Some runners would have preferred to know if it was 3 or 4, so I check my watch. Four kilometers to go. The course goes down and I can see the last aid point. I stop there the time to eat two quarters of an orange. As I\u2019m off again, I feel how tired I am. My back hurts, my feet hurt, my legs hurt. I try to forget the pain but it won\u2019t go away. I continue, the finish line can\u2019t be far. Soon I get on an asphalt portion of the course and I feel so relieved that I start speeding up. There are more people here, cheering, making me realize how empty the woods were. The course is still going up and down but now I\u2019m running on soft dry sand, doing my best not to slow down, without much success I must say. \u201cGo right, there are stairs near the young boy\u201d somebody tells me. I see the boy and go toward him but this is not the way, I have to go right, by the volunteers. I can feel the pain invading my body like some kind of decease, but I\u2019m stronger. I am a marathoner, I am a runner, I can do it! Right after the stairs is the beach, I know the last kilometers are on the beach, so I must be near. I get to the hard, wet, sand. \u201cIt is almost over\u201d a runner tells me as I pass him by. I speed up, and speed up some more. I pass by another runner who is struggling. \u201cCome on, you can do it\u201d I say, staying by his side. \u201cGo on, I\u2019ve got cramps, it will be ok\u201d he tells me. I can see in his eyes he decided to restrain himself, so I go, and after 2 hours and 36 minutes, finish my first trail.", "sentiment_score": 0.050036210526315794, "postID": "z131sfwaekqhs34q104chxtxskbjjt5bmvo0k"}

Starting from fourth on the grid, the Yamaha Factory Racing rider was yet again off the start line like a bullet and the first rider through turn one in the lead. With both Dani Pedrosa and Marc Marquez snapping at his heels he put his head down and tried to break away. With 16 laps to go, Pedrosa made his move at the end of the back straight, taking the lead. Marquez then moved up into third and began an epic battle with Lorenzo, the two swapping positions multiple times and passing within millimetres of each other at speeds of over 190km per hour. With 11 laps to go Marquez was able to make his final pass tick on the inside of turn 14, leaving Lorenzo to hold third to the line and claim third on the podium. Teammate Valentino Rossi dropped initially to fourth off the line from his second place grid position, tucked in behind Marquez on the first lap. The nine-time world champion made a move on Marquez at turn 10 but was unable to pass and settled back into fourth. Rossi spent several laps holding off the advances of Alvaro Bautista, narrowly escaping an incident when the Spanish rider overshot turn one, just missing Rossi as he ran wide. The rest of the race proved to be a lonely one as he held his position in fourth, crossing the line just over ten seconds behind the leader. The results from the first of the overseas triple header sees Lorenzo hold second in the championship, now on 255 points, Rossi holds fourth on 198 points. The team now moves directly to Australia for the next round at the Phillip Island circuit next weekend. Jorge Lorenzo 3rd | +6.669 | 20 Laps \u201cWe were much slower than the others today, especially after three or four laps. I tried to open a gap at the beginning like always but there was +0 on the board after a couple of laps. When Dani passed I tried to stay with him and also then again when Marc passed me. I tried to pass him some more times to make him nervous but it was impossible, he was much stronger today so we couldn&#39;t do much more. To win the championship is almost impossible but I would like to finish second in the championship and win as many races as possible.\u201d Valentino Rossi 4th | +10.351 | 20 Laps \u201cToday was half and half for me, for sure we improved and made another step, improving the setting of the bike and I was able to be very close to Jorge. It looks like today our competitors had an advantage here; they were able to keep a better rhythm than us. Starting from second I hoped to arrive on the podium but I knew the top three guys were very strong. At the beginning of the race I lost some time as I had a problem with the front brakes. We continue to work and push and fight to be in with the top three.\u201d Crutchlow and Smith battle hard in muggy Malaysia Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team riders Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith battled hard in baking hot conditions to claim sixth and seventh respectively in front of a record crowd of over 84,000 fans packed into the Sepang International Circuit. Temperatures still hit over 30 degrees, despite heavy cloud cover and a strong wind blowing around the vast Malaysian motorsport arena, when Crutchlow and Smith engaged in an early battle at the start of the physically challenging 20-lap encounter. A brilliant start from rookie Smith moved him ahead of his compatriot on the opening lap before Crutchlow moved back into the top six. From that early juncture, former World Supersport Champion Crutchlow was caught in a long and tough battle with Spaniard Alvaro Bautista, which went right down to the chequered flag. Crutchlow and Bautista exchanged several overtakes in an exciting battle but the 27-year-old missed out on his first top five finish since the Indianapolis round in August by just 0.152s. Today\u2019s result though consolidated Crutchlow\u2019s position as the leading non-factory rider in the World Championship rankings on 166-points, which keeps him 30 points clear of Bautista with just three races remaining. Smith strengthened his quest for a top 10 overall finish in the Championship standings after he rode to a lonely but very valuable seventh position. The platform for his 10th top 10 finish of the campaign was a terrific launch off the line that put him right on the back of the leading group in the opening exchanges. Unable to keep himself in the hunt for a third top six finish, Smith kept razor sharp concentration in the extreme heat to streak away from those behind with relative ease and his fastest lap of the race was only just over 0.7s behind Crutchlow\u2019s. The nine-points collected this afternoon could prove vital in the chase for 10th in the final standings, with the 22-year-old now six points clear of main challenger Aleix Espargaro. The Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team has little time to catch its breath now, with the squad heading off to Australia for the second of a gruelling flyaway triple-header that concludes in Japan on October 27. Cal Crutchlow 6th \u2013 166 points _\u201cIt was a difficult race and I am very pleased to be in the top six, though it would have been better to have won that fight with Alvaro. That\u2019s about my level at the moment and we knew this is not an easy track for Yamaha. I lost quite a bit of time fighting with Alvaro because I was looking to push on and maybe chase Valentino. But at the start I couldn\u2019t stop the bike with the soft front tyre and I had a few moments. And I was also struggling with a lack of rear grip and that made it quite a difficult race. It was a good battle with Alvaro and it was a pity he just beat me but at the of end of the day he is on a package very close to the one that won the race today. I\u2019m still satisfied with sixth but I am not so happy with the gap to Dani at the front. I am confident though we will be stronger at Phillip Island.\u201d Bradley Smith 7th - 89 points &quot;To be honest today was a good way to end a very positive weekend. During the last three days we improved in every single session, we made progress with the setting of the bike and me finishing in 7th position is obviously a pleasant fact for my Championship standing. Today the track conditions were very tricky and with the higher temperatures the behavior of the bike was very different to what I experienced during the whole weekend and it took me awhile to adjust my riding style. But my second half of the race was quite strong and I am pleased with this. Furthermore we improved my feeling on full fuel load where I normally struggled a lot and also finishing the race still seeing Cal and Alvaro was a very positive feeling. So altogether I\u2019m truly satisfied with this event and I will fly to Australia full of confidence and looking forward to the race next week.&quot;  #yamaha #yamaharacing #motogp #valentinorossi #jorgelorenzo #calcrutchlow #bradleysmith #monsterenergy #monster #Sepang #Malaysia #motogp2013 #jl99 #vr46", "replyCount": 1, "cleanContent": "Lorenzo Battles for Sepang Podium Defending world champion Jorge Lorenzo battled hard during the early stages of today\u2019s Malaysian Motorcycle Grand Prix to take third on the podium.

Lowes had come into the weekend 49 points ahead of rival Kenan Sofuoglu and enjoyed a typical battle between the two that saw him secure second on the podium after a red flag brought the race to an early close. The result put the 23yr old British rider on 225 points, 44 clear of Sofuoglu with one race to go. Lowes has enjoyed a dominant season on the R6, taking an impressive five race wins and a total of ten podiums on his way to his maiden title. The win is also Yamaha\u2019s third World Supersport title in the last five years. Sam Lowes - 2013 World Supersport Champion \u201cI\u2019m very happy and want to say a massive thank you to Yamaha and to everybody involved in getting me here. From when I first rode the R6 in Jerez and joined the team I felt a great feeling and I knew we could fight for the championship. To feel it and do it are two different things so I\u2019m very happy to be world champion. Today\u2019s race was great fun, sometimes its nice to be in a battle and take your mind off the bigger picture. I enjoyed that race a lot. I\u2019d like to say a massive thank you to Kenan; he\u2019s a great rider, I classify him as a friend and I respect him a lot for this season. Thank you for the fight!

We\u2019ve put a lot of effort in this season and as a result we\u2019re back on top and we\u2019ve got another championship. Yamaha would like to say a big thank you to Sam who has been doing an amazing job and also the team who worked hard all year. I also need to say big thank you to Yamaha Motor Europe Technical Coordinator Torleif Hartelman who worked tremendously hard with Sam and the team for this fantastic result.

Lowes had come into the weekend 49 points ahead of rival Kenan Sofuoglu and enjoyed a typical battle between the two that saw him secure second on the podium after a red flag brought the race to an early close. The result put the 23yr old British rider on 225 points, 44 clear of Sofuoglu with one race to go. Lowes has enjoyed a dominant season on the R6, taking an impressive five race wins and a total of ten podiums on his way to his maiden title.

Defending world champion Lorenzo made a flying start from second on the grid to lead the MotoGP field into turn one with rivals Marc Marquez and Dani Pedrosa in pursuit. The Mallorcan\u2019s stunning first lap pace saw a one second gap created as they headed into the second lap. Pedrosa and Marquez remained hot on the heels of Lorenzo until with 18 laps to go the two chasing riders made contact, Marquez running wide and Pedrosa crashing out. With ten laps to go Marquez caught and passed Lorenzo, but was unable to pull away as the reigning champion tucked in behind to give chase. Lorenzo eventually crossed the line in second, just 1.3 seconds back from Marquez. Teammate Rossi held his fourth grid position off the line and into turn one, closely followed by Alvaro Bautista and Stefan Bradl. The nine-time world champion, promoted to third by Pedrosa\u2019s crash, was able to hold the provisional podium spot until a late attack by Bautista with six laps remaining. The fight for third ran until the penultimate lap, Rossi making the decisive move through the uphill section of the track to retake the final podium spot and hold it to the line. The race result keeps Lorenzo in second in the standings, 20 points ahead of Pedrosa and 39 behind Marquez in the lead.

Jorge Lorenzo - 2nd / +1.356 / 23 laps \u201cMy tactic was to start well and open a gap like I did in the last races. I could make one second at the beginning but then simply Marc was faster. When he caught me I closed the throttle to try to save some energy until the end; then he passed me and tried to go away. I tried my best to catch him but it was impossible. Today he was faster than me; there are no excuses. We have to congratulate him and now we think about the next races.

Crutchlow was one of the main protagonists in the most enthralling battle of a dramatic 23-lap race, as the British rider fought superbly for third position with Valentino Rossi, Alvaro Bautista and Stefan Bradl throughout. The 27-year-old displayed typical fighting spirit to keep himself locked in the battle right down to the last lap, though he was just unable to force his way into contention to claim a fifth podium of the campaign. Crutchlow\u2019s sixth position saw him pick up 10 more precious World Championship points that keep him firmly in control of fifth place in the rankings and on course to end 2013 as the leading non-factory rider. Today\u2019s race, which took place in the coolest conditions of the weekend, saw rookie Smith deliver one of his most impressive performances of the season. Taking full advantage of improved braking performance after tweaking his riding style earlier this weekend, Smith finished in a terrific seventh position. The highlight of his race was his excellent charge away from experienced rival Andrea Dovizioso after passing the Italian on lap three. The 22-year-old maintained a consistent pace throughout the race and one pleasing aspect of his performance today was he managed to finish just over 30 seconds behind eventual winner Marc Marquez. That improvement on recent races bodes well for the final races of the campaign, which includes three back-to-back flyaway races in Malaysia, Australia and Japan. Cal Crutchlow - 6th \u2013 156 points &quot;I am not unsatisfied with a top 6 result this weekend, I just think we are far from where we should be and that is clearly because we are lacking speed. We lose more than 10km/h every single lap on the straight and in acceleration and that is not good for us, we honestly don\u2019t know why also because we used a new engine since this morning and I really don\u2019t need to find excuses because you could clearly see it on TV how much I was struggling. In any case we can still take quite a few positives out of this weekend, we had two days of track time less than the others and we don\u2019t have the seamless gearbox but we were still able to finish just 1,5 seconds behind Valentino, so we have not done a bad job. Now I am looking forward to the overseas and I am confident we can still fight for the podium this season.&quot; Bradley Smith - 7th \u2013 80 points &quot;The positive point of today is that we scored our best result since Sachsenring and altogether it was good to stay in front of the Ducatis and especially to pull away from them at the end of the race was a nice feeling. I still believe that we have some more potential to improve our race setting . This will surely be our main aim for the flyaway races and I have no doubt that we will progress is this area. But all in all I can\u2019t be unsatisfied with this weekend, especially considering how tough Friday was, when things did not really go according to plan, so to travel to Malaysia with a 7th position in my luggage is not too bad.&quot; #yamaha #yamaharacing #motogp #jorgelorenzo #valentinorossi #spain #aragorn #calcrutchlow #monsterenergy", "replyCount": 8, "cleanContent": "Double Delight for Yamaha in Aragon Yamaha Factory Racing riders Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi fought an intense battle this afternoon to take second and third respectively in the Gran Premio Iveco de Aragon.

The victory, his sixth successive Italian Grand Prix win, was delivered after a 28 lap race of inch perfect riding from the reigning world champion. Starting from second on the grid, Lorenzo out dragged championship rival and pole sitter Marc Marquez to the first corner, taking the hole shot into turn one. He proved immediately impossible to follow, opening up a gap of just over a second on the first lap and keeping the pressure up as the race wound on. He was quick to build a comfortable gap to the chasing pack that was unbroken to the line, allowing him to claim his fifth Grand Prix win of the season. Valentino Rossi initially dropped a couple of places to fifth off the start line but was quick to re-pass Aleix Espargaro on the first lap to slot into fourth chasing Marquez and Dani Pedrosa ahead. The Local hero was hot on the tail of Marquez and took advantage of an error by the young Spaniard to dive past up the inside and move into third place chasing Pedrosa. Unfortunately some issues with braking cost some valuable time and Marquez was able to re-pass, leaving Rossi in a lonely fourth position for the remainder of the race to the finish line. Lorenzo\u2019s stunning victory moves him up into second place in the championship, tied on points with Pedrosa at 219, 34 behind Marquez with five races remaining. Rossi\u2019s fourth place finish keeps him in fourth place in the championship on 169 points, 23 ahead of Cal Crutchlow in fifth. Jorge Lorenzo - Position 1st- Time 42.39.802 \u201cLuckily we improved the bike a lot in warm up, especially in braking so we improved the lap time and the pace quite a bit. I was convinced to follow my strategy of the last couple of races which was to try to break away and finally I could do it. The first two laps I had a big advantage so I had to keep pushing to maintain a distance because they never gave up and wanted to catch me. I\u2019m happy, we recovered five points and we are closer to Marc. I need to be constant and try to win races and stay focused.\u201d Valentino Rossi - Position 4th- Time +5.990 \u201cAll the weekend our performance was quite good, I stayed with the top three and I raised my level, especially in qualifying, I could push stronger with the new tyres and make the first row. The expectation for the race was very high, after the start the top guys were very fast but my fastest lap was close to theirs. Unfortunately after some laps I was in trouble in braking and entering corners. I was struggling in hard braking and made some mistakes going wide and step-by-step they pulled away. I made a small mistake on turn seven and lost two seconds and by then already I had too much disadvantage. It&#39;s a pity because we wanted to try for the podium here in Italy in front of all the fans in Misano. We hope the weather remains good for tomorrow as we have to try some new parts.\u201d  Crutchlow battles to super sixth in San Marino Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow stormed back into the top six today at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli to remain firmly on course to be the leading non-factory rider in 2013. And it was almost a double top 10 finish for the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 squad, with rookie Bradley Smith missing out on claiming 10th spot by the narrowest margins at the end of a 28-lap race that was played out in front of a crowd of 50,949 fans. Crutchlow bounced back from a tough home race at Silverstone earlier this month in typically determined fashion, the British rider brilliantly leading Stefan Bradl in fifth position for the majority of a race that took place in cloudy and windy conditions. A faultless performance from Crutchlow seemed certain to be rewarded with a top five result, as he brilliantly defended from a hard charging Bradl right down to the final lap. The German was not to be outdone though and a calculated move at Turn 8 dropped Crutchlow back to sixth. The British rider was unable to retaliate despite a determined late attack but Crutchlow\u2019s battling performance keeps the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team in control of third spot in the all-important Team World Championship standings. Today\u2019s result, which was a ninth top sixth finish of an impressive 2013, means Crutchlow remains comfortably the highest ranked non-factory rider in the World Championship standings on 146-points. Smith was less than 0.2s away from continuing his outstanding run of top 10 finishes in his rookie premier class campaign. Locked in a fight for long periods with Andrea Dovizioso, Nicky Hayden and Michele Pirro, Smith almost overhauled the latter with a tremendous last lap attack. Smith set his best lap of the race on the final lap but just couldn\u2019t find a way to make a clean pass on Pirro and he had to settle for 11th.

The top six is not what I am aiming for right now but I had no confidence with the bike all weekend, and it was important to get a strong finish. It was a very hard race because Stefan just sat on my back wheel from the first lap to the end and unfortunately he managed to find a way to pass me in the lasts corners. I tried my best to take fifth back but it wasn\u2019t meant to be, but I think the whole of the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team showed a lot of fighting qualities this weekend.

I wasn\u2019t as fast as I\u2019d hoped and again it was difficult at the start of the race on a full fuel load. But we have learned a lot all weekend and particularly in the race and now I am looking forward to tomorrow\u2019s test where we can try a few things to improve our package.

Sixth place is not what we are looking for or what is the real potential of Cal. But he showed the whole race that he is a true fighter and it was unfortunate that Stefan was able to pass him right at the end. In the end it was a strong race and I want to thank Cal because he never gave up and as always he gave all he had, even though he has not been confident on the bike all weekend. Bradley had a tough weekend too. We knew Ducati would be strong here like always because they test on this track frequently and Bradley did a very good job. He set his fastest lap on the last lap and that shows there is still room for improvement but the whole team has demonstrated a lot of fighting spirit this weekend and I am proud of everybody involved. Finally I must pass on my congratulations to Jorge and Yamaha. Jorge was exceptional and he showed that this World Championship is not over yet. And I am also delighted to see the new YZR-M1 seamless shift gearbox make a winning debut, which bodes well for the future.\u201d #yamaha #yamaharacing #motogp #valentinorossi #jorgelorenzo #calcrutchlow #bradleysmith #monsterenergy #monster #SanMarino #Misano #motogp2013 #jl99 #vr46", "replyCount": 6, "cleanContent": "Lorenzo Delivers with Masterful Misano Victory Yamaha Factory Racing\u2019s Jorge Lorenzo delivered a masterful performance today to win the San Marino Grand Prix in stunning form. The victory, his sixth successive Italian Grand Prix win, was delivered after a 28 lap race of inch perfect riding from the reigning world champion. Starting from second on the grid, Lorenzo out dragged championship rival and pole sitter Marc Marquez to the first corner, taking the hole shot into turn one. He proved immediately impossible to follow, opening up a gap of just over a second on the first lap and keeping the pressure up as the race wound on. He was quick to build a comfortable gap to the chasing pack that was unbroken to the line, allowing him to claim his fifth Grand Prix win of the season. Valentino Rossi initially dropped a couple of places to fifth off the start line but was quick to re-pass Aleix Espargaro on the first lap to slot into fourth chasing Marquez and Dani Pedrosa ahead. The Local hero was hot on the tail of Marquez and took advantage of an error by the young Spaniard to dive past up the inside and move into third place chasing Pedrosa. Unfortunately some issues with braking cost some valuable time and Marquez was able to re-pass, leaving Rossi in a lonely fourth position for the remainder of the race to the finish line. Lorenzo\u2019s stunning victory moves him up into second place in the championship, tied on points with Pedrosa at 219, 34 behind Marquez with five races remaining. Rossi\u2019s fourth place finish keeps him in fourth place in the championship on 169 points, 23 ahead of Cal Crutchlow in fifth. Jorge Lorenzo - Position 1st- Time 42.39.802 \u201cLuckily we improved the bike a lot in warm up, especially in braking so we improved the lap time and the pace quite a bit. I was convinced to follow my strategy of the last couple of races which was to try to break away and finally I could do it. The first two laps I had a big advantage so I had to keep pushing to maintain a distance because they never gave up and wanted to catch me. I\u2019m happy, we recovered five points and we are closer to Marc. I need to be constant and try to win races and stay focused.\u201d Valentino Rossi - Position 4th- Time +5.990 \u201cAll the weekend our performance was quite good, I stayed with the top three and I raised my level, especially in qualifying, I could push stronger with the new tyres and make the first row. The expectation for the race was very high, after the start the top guys were very fast but my fastest lap was close to theirs. Unfortunately after some laps I was in trouble in braking and entering corners. I was struggling in hard braking and made some mistakes going wide and step-by-step they pulled away. I made a small mistake on turn seven and lost two seconds and by then already I had too much disadvantage. It's a pity because we wanted to try for the podium here in Italy in front of all the fans in Misano. We hope the weather remains good for tomorrow as we have to try some new parts.\u201d Crutchlow battles to super sixth in San Marino Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow stormed back into the top six today at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli to remain firmly on course to be the leading non-factory rider in 2013. And it was almost a double top 10 finish for the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 squad, with rookie Bradley Smith missing out on claiming 10th spot by the narrowest margins at the end of a 28-lap race that was played out in front of a crowd of 50,949 fans. Crutchlow bounced back from a tough home race at Silverstone earlier this month in typically determined fashion, the British rider brilliantly leading Stefan Bradl in fifth position for the majority of a race that took place in cloudy and windy conditions. A faultless performance from Crutchlow seemed certain to be rewarded with a top five result, as he brilliantly defended from a hard charging Bradl right down to the final lap. The German was not to be outdone though and a calculated move at Turn 8 dropped Crutchlow back to sixth. The British rider was unable to retaliate despite a determined late attack but Crutchlow\u2019s battling performance keeps the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team in control of third spot in the all-important Team World Championship standings. Today\u2019s result, which was a ninth top sixth finish of an impressive 2013, means Crutchlow remains comfortably the highest ranked non-factory rider in the World Championship standings on 146-points. Smith was less than 0.2s away from continuing his outstanding run of top 10 finishes in his rookie premier class campaign. Locked in a fight for long periods with Andrea Dovizioso, Nicky Hayden and Michele Pirro, Smith almost overhauled the latter with a tremendous last lap attack. Smith set his best lap of the race on the final lap but just couldn\u2019t find a way to make a clean pass on Pirro and he had to settle for 11th. The consolation though was the 22-year-old moved back into 10th place in the World Championship standings having joined Aleix Espargaro on 71-points Cal Crutchlow - Position 6th - Time +22.599 \u201cIt is a shame that I lost fifth place on the last lap but it has been a very difficult weekend and I am happy to come away with this result.

Lowes made a less than perfect start from pole, his eighth of the season, but recovered well and had pushed his YZF-R6 back into the lead of the race by the third lap. By mid race he had built a comfortable lead over Championship rival Kenan Sofuoglu who then crashed out, allowing Lowes to cruise to his fifth win of 2013.

The defending world champion made another lightening race start this afternoon, flying from second on the grid to take the hole shot into turn one ahead of arch rival Marc Marquez. Although unable to break away, Lorenzo executed an unbroken string of inch perfect laps to maintain the lead until just three laps from the end when Marquez attempted to take control of the race. His lead was not to last as Lorenzo fought back a lap later to regain the lead, beginning a battle which was to last to the last corner as the two exchanged places in the fight for the lead. It was Lorenzo who emerged victorious, making the definitive move just two corners from the end and holding the tighter line into the last turn to cross the line victorious and claim his fourth win of the season. Team mate Valentino Rossi made an excellent start from sixth on the grid, initially jumping three places to slot in behind Marquez in third position. Still struggling to find an optimum set up for the first few race laps, the nine-time world champion then slipped back to sixth before mounting his fight back. With 12 laps to go Rossi was swapping positions in a close fight with German rider Stefan Bradl, emerging the victor two laps later and then hunting down Alvaro Bautista in fourth. The battle with Bautista was to begin with just three laps remaining and continue to the finish line, Rossi\u2019s race craft eventually giving him the upper hand and earning him fourth place at the flag. The results bring Lorenzo five points closer to the championship leader Marquez, the point difference now 39 as Lorenzo sits on 194, just nine points behind Pedrosa in second. Rossi continues in fourth in the standings, now on 156 points and building the gap to Cal Crutchlow in fifth to 20 points. The next Grand Prix takes place in two weeks time, the San Marino Grand Prix on 15th September. Jorge Lorenzo - Position: 1st - Time: 40.52.515 &quot;This was one of the best races I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019m really happy and really pleased. It\u2019s a very important win. I pushed from the beginning to try and open a gap, even more than in recent races but it was impossible. Marc never gives up, even if he\u2019s a little bit injured after the warm up. He overtook me three laps from the end so I studied him a little for one lap and I saw he was struggling in some braking so I overtook him on the corner where he crashed. I pushed in the last lap to the maximum, I opened a little gap but I made a mistake in braking and almost crashed. When he overtook me three corners from the end I thought it was over again and second place but then he opened a little gap in the last corner so I thought &quot;now or never&quot; and I tried and got it. To be honest I\u2019m not thinking about the championship, I\u2019m thinking just to enjoy this victory which was very special to get then focus on Misano!&quot; Valentino Rossi - Position: 4th - Time: +13.233 \u201cFor me this result is a bit more positive than in Brno. Every time I come here I have a bad result, this time we worked in a different and better way. The fourth place is better than in Brno, but it is still a fourth place. Unfortunately I made a good start but in the first laps the other guys between the second and seventh lap were a lot faster than me, but the second half of the race was not so bad. We will continue to work hard, we never give up and are not so far now. We have a constant pace and we are nearly there but we need to go a bit faster, we still have to work to improve our pace. We made a modification between warm up and the race that gave me a better feeling with the front.\u201d Courageous Crutchlow ends bruising British Grand Prix in seventh Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow showed tremendous determination and desire in this afternoon\u2019s British Grand Prix, the home crowd hero racing to a seventh place finish in front of a record attendance at Silverstone. British teammate Bradley Smith also demonstrated his battling qualities in the 20-lap race to secure ninth position, which was his eighth top 10 finish in 12 appearances on Yamaha\u2019s YZR-M1 machine. Almost 74,000 British fans were cheering when Crutchlow kick off the race in a decent way from the front row of the grid. But riding in considerable pain and discomfort after three high-speed crashes in the build-up to today\u2019s action, the 27-year-old was unable to keep himself in contention for the top six, despite producing yet another performance that typifies his fighting spirit and never-give-up attitude. After defying the pain, Crutchlow still got a rapturous reception from his loyal home crowd, who were appreciative of his efforts to claim a 10th top 10 finish of the season. Smith kept his challenge for a top 10 position in the overall World Championship standings on course after he was narrowly beaten to eighth place in the closing stages. The 22-year-old attacked from the off and brilliantly kept Nicky Hayden and Andrea Dovizioso at bay until four laps from the end. Relegated to ninth, Smith mounted a relentless pursuit of American Hayden in the final stages but he couldn\u2019t find a way through and the chequered flag saw him less than 0.2s behind the 2006 MotoGP World Champion. Cal Crutchlow - Position: 7th - Time: +26.299 \u201cHonestly I\u2019m pleased the weekend is over and at least we finished the race. It certainly wasn\u2019t the easiest race I have ever done and it is disappointing that I couldn\u2019t challenge. But after the crashes I just had no power at all in my right arm and I was also lacking grip at the start when the tyres were cold. Unfortunately that is what happens when you crash three times in a weekend. I didn\u2019t give myself enough time to get laps under the belt to set the bike up properly. The only positive we can take away is that we have been faster than last year. But it\u2019s definitely less than what I hoped for when we arrived at the track on Wednesday. Congratulations though to Jorge, Marc and Dani because they put on an incredible show today and had fantastic speed. I\u2019d have loved to be up there with them and now I\u2019m just looking forward to a few quiet days at home before we go to Misano where I hope to fighting closer to the front again.\u201d Bradley Smith - Position: 9th - Time: +36.119 \u201cI was very pleased with my start and we decided to race with the softer rear tyre option, as we were lacking a bit of grip during the whole weekend. I wanted the sun to come out but unfortunately the temperatures remained cold and after just three laps we already knew that the race would be difficult one. Probably the hard tyre would have been the right choice but we did not have enough time to evaluate it yesterday. We did what we could and even if I didn\u2019t want to finish behind Nicky, I decided it was safer the finish the race after Andrea crashed out just in front of me. All in all it has been a tough weekend but riding in front of nearly 75.000 British here today has been an incredible feeling.\u201d  #yamaha #yamaharacing #motogp #valentinorossi #jorgelorenzo #calcrutchlow #bradleysmith #monsterenergy #monster #UK #Silverstone #motogp2013 #jl99 #vr46", "replyCount": 2, "cleanContent": "Lorenzo Shines with Stunning Silverstone Victory Yamaha Factory Racing\u2019s Jorge Lorenzo delivered a stunning performance today to take victory in the British Grand Prix at the Silverstone circuit.

We will continue to work hard, we never give up and are not so far now. We have a constant pace and we are nearly there but we need to go a bit faster, we still have to work to improve our pace. We made a modification between warm up and the race that gave me a better feeling with the front.\u201d Courageous Crutchlow ends bruising British Grand Prix in seventh Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow showed tremendous determination and desire in this afternoon\u2019s British Grand Prix, the home crowd hero racing to a seventh place finish in front of a record attendance at Silverstone. British teammate Bradley Smith also demonstrated his battling qualities in the 20-lap race to secure ninth position, which was his eighth top 10 finish in 12 appearances on Yamaha\u2019s YZR-M1 machine. Almost 74,000 British fans were cheering when Crutchlow kick off the race in a decent way from the front row of the grid. But riding in considerable pain and discomfort after three high-speed crashes in the build-up to today\u2019s action, the 27-year-old was unable to keep himself in contention for the top six, despite producing yet another performance that typifies his fighting spirit and never-give-up attitude. After defying the pain, Crutchlow still got a rapturous reception from his loyal home crowd, who were appreciative of his efforts to claim a 10th top 10 finish of the season. Smith kept his challenge for a top 10 position in the overall World Championship standings on course after he was narrowly beaten to eighth place in the closing stages. The 22-year-old attacked from the off and brilliantly kept Nicky Hayden and Andrea Dovizioso at bay until four laps from the end. Relegated to ninth, Smith mounted a relentless pursuit of American Hayden in the final stages but he couldn\u2019t find a way through and the chequered flag saw him less than 0.2s behind the 2006 MotoGP World Champion. Cal Crutchlow - Position: 7th - Time: +26.299 \u201cHonestly I\u2019m pleased the weekend is over and at least we finished the race. It certainly wasn\u2019t the easiest race I have ever done and it is disappointing that I couldn\u2019t challenge. But after the crashes I just had no power at all in my right arm and I was also lacking grip at the start when the tyres were cold. Unfortunately that is what happens when you crash three times in a weekend. I didn\u2019t give myself enough time to get laps under the belt to set the bike up properly. The only positive we can take away is that we have been faster than last year. But it\u2019s definitely less than what I hoped for when we arrived at the track on Wednesday. Congratulations though to Jorge, Marc and Dani because they put on an incredible show today and had fantastic speed. I\u2019d have loved to be up there with them and now I\u2019m just looking forward to a few quiet days at home before we go to Misano where I hope to fighting closer to the front again.\u201d Bradley Smith - Position: 9th - Time: +36.119 \u201cI was very pleased with my start and we decided to race with the softer rear tyre option, as we were lacking a bit of grip during the whole weekend. I wanted the sun to come out but unfortunately the temperatures remained cold and after just three laps we already knew that the race would be difficult one. Probably the hard tyre would have been the right choice but we did not have enough time to evaluate it yesterday. We did what we could and even if I didn\u2019t want to finish behind Nicky, I decided it was safer the finish the race after Andrea crashed out just in front of me. All in all it has been a tough weekend but riding in front of nearly 75.000 British here today has been an incredible feeling.\u201d #yamaha #yamaharacing #motogp #valentinorossi #jorgelorenzo #calcrutchlow #bradleysmith #monsterenergy #monster #UK #Silverstone #motogp2013 #jl99 #vr46", "sentiment_score": 0.08181791697013839, "postID": "z12fi1zwkuugyrprn04cdbuiywi0xrgxw34"}

As usual Lorenzo was first out of the pit lane and onto the track as the 15-minute qualifying heat began. His first lap was a scorching 2\u201901.497 lap, smashing the lap record of the circuit. Rival Marc Marquez immediately responded, snatching the top spot back from Lorenzo. The reigning world champion kept the pressure on and delivered a second stunning lap, moving 0.070 seconds ahead of Marquez with a 2\u201901.217 to retake provisional pole. With half the session now gone Lorenzo returned to the pits for a quick change of rubber and was back out on the track with just under six minutes of track time remaining. He kept the pace up, dipping even further under the old lap record with a 2\u201900.819 second lap. Unfortunately it was not quite enough to secure pole, as his rival Marquez responded again, just beating him to the top spot by 0.128 seconds. After making a strong start on Friday in free practice and confident of making another step today, Valentino Rossi took sixth place on the second row of the grid for tomorrow\u2019s race. Rossi was the second rider out as the session started, tailing teammate Lorenzo onto the circuit. His first set of rubber delivered a best time of 2\u201902.763 before returning to the pits for a new rear. Back out again just behind Lorenzo, the nine-time world champion was able to make a big step in time, getting down to a 2\u201902.109 lap to secure sixth on the second row of the grid for tomorrow\u2019s race. Jorge Lorenzo - Position: 2nd - Time: 2.00.819 - Laps: 7 \u201cIt\u2019s not fantastic because we didn&#39;t make pole position. I was surprised about the improvement from the pace lap to the qualifying lap, it was a big jump, almost one second and a half. When I saw my lap time on my bike I thought I made pole position but when I saw the classification I saw P2 and was disappointed as I put all my effort into the lap, but it wasn&#39;t enough. Race pace is good but we have to see where the others are tomorrow.\u201d Valentino Rossi - Position: 6th - Time: 2.02.109 - Laps: 7 \u201cI\u2019m not so happy with the distance from Lorenzo and Marquez, they did a fantastic job but I\u2019m happy about the second row. It\u2019s very important and better than the third row. My lap time is quite fast but especially I\u2019m quite satisfied with today because we improved the setting of the bike this afternoon and I\u2019m a lot more constant with pace. I can stay with a good pace which is important for tomorrow. Now we have to try to make another step, I have two or three corners where I\u2019m not so strong and I\u2019m suffering on some bumps. Tomorrow we will try to improve.\u201d  Crutchlow bounces back to claim heroic home front row British hero Cal Crutchlow showed amazing speed and resilience in front of his home crowd at Silverstone today to claim a stunning sixth front row start of 2013 after bouncing back from two heavy crashes in practice. The Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider put a huge home crowd through some nail-biting moments once again ahead of the British Grand Prix after he escaped injury in two high-speed falls in cool conditions during this morning\u2019s FP3. Nursing nasty abrasions to his right arm, Crutchlow had British fans on the edge of their seats again this afternoon when the 27-year-old demonstrated incredible bravery and skill to power his YZR-M1 machine to third position on the grid in a tense 15-minute QP2. In gloriously sunny but cool conditions, Crutchlow\u2019s best lap of 2.01.425 put him behind dominant Spanish duo Marc Marquez and Jorge Lorenzo for the start of tomorrow\u2019s 20-lap race. Despite feeling below his peak physical best after the big crashes this morning, Crutchlow remains full of confidence that he can become the first British rider since 2000 to claim a premier class podium on home soil. Rookie Bradley Smith will also start his first home MotoGP race from inside the top 10 after he was able to set encouraging lap times throughout the weekend that bodes well for a strong challenge in tomorrow\u2019s Silverstone showdown. Smith advanced comfortably from QP1 with a lap of 2.03.110, which saw him dominate the opening 15-minute qualifying session by close to a second. In the heat of battle in QP2, the 22-year-old further improved his pace to an impressive 2.02.409, which was only 0.3s away from securing Smith a place on the second row of the grid for the third time this season. Cal Crutchlow - Position: 3rd - Time: 2.01.447 - Laps: 7 \u201cWell that was just a normal Saturday for me at Silverstone! After what happened in 2011 and 2012, the last thing I needed was a crash, so to have two made it even worse. Both were very fast crashes and I am thankful not to have been injured, though my right arm is covered in abrasions and is quite painful because of the swelling. The first crash was my fault because the front tyre was too cold. And in the second one, with my arm hurting, I just couldn\u2019t hold on when the bike starting moving around on the brakes. I\u2019ve got to say a massive thanks to my Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team because they put in an amazing effort to at least get me out this afternoon. After all that happened this morning it feels great to be on the front row, but the gap to Marc and Jorge is pretty big and it will be tough to beat them tomorrow. I\u2019ll be giving it my all though because the support from the British crowd today really spurred me on. They\u2019ve really got behind me and it was a good feeling to bounce back from the crashes to get a front row.\u201d Bradley Smith - Position: 10th - Time: 2.02.409 - Laps: 7 \u201cMy lap time is something to be really proud of today because we made a big jump compared to the rest of the weekend. The overall result is not what we expected but going into QP1 showed we have been having a tough weekend. So to end up close to the top six is positive but that gap to the front is obviously a big step. I still believe we can make another step with the bike for tomorrow. It will be a long race but it might be an advantage to be able to follow and learn something because on this track it seems easier to chase than make a lap time on your own. It has not been an easy weekend but I\u2019ve not made any mistakes and got faster every session, so I am looking forward the race and rewarding the amazing support from the British crowd.&quot; #yamaha #yamaharacing #motogp #valentinorossi #jorgelorenzo #calcrutchlow #bradleysmith #monsterenergy #monster #UK #Silverstone #motogp2013 #jl99 #vr46", "replyCount": 2, "cleanContent": "Lorenzo Duels in Dramatic Silverstone Qualifying Yamaha Factory Racing\u2019s Jorge Lorenzo took second place on the grid this afternoon in a dramatic duel for pole position ahead of tomorrow\u2019s British Grand Prix at the Silverstone circuit.

The Mallorcan wrapped up day one as the fastest rider overall, 0.224 seconds clear of closest rival Marc Marquez. His fastest time of 2\u201902.734 seconds takes him underneath the fastest race lap of last year\u2019s Grand Prix, set by himself. Lorenzo led the entire second session and completed the morning practice in second, 0.219 seconds behind Marquez. Valentino Rossi made big steps forward over the course of today. The Italian nine-time world champion was 0.866 seconds off the fastest lap in the morning session in sixth place with a 2\u201904.682 lap. Some hard work over the day saw him improve by over a second to complete the afternoon practice in fifth with a 2\u201903.480 second lap. Jorge Lorenzo - Position: 1st - Time: 2.02.734 - Laps: 18 \u201cI started very fast because I improved almost one second and a half in the beginning; I was surprised with the improvement. At this track, when the rear tyre starts to drop it\u2019s very difficult to keep the same pace so we have to work hard to make a constant bike that works over long distance. I\u2019m satisfied because I think we have the possibility to fight for the victory this time.\u201d Valentino Rossi - Position: 5th - Time: 2.03.480 - Laps: 18 \u201cI enjoyed today a lot, this track is great. If you are able to ride at the limit and have a good feeling with the bike, it\u2019s very funny because it\u2019s very fast, the track is so wide you go a lot of time at full throttle. I\u2019m quite happy with the first day, especially because in the last two years I suffered a lot here in Silverstone. We made a good step, but we still have to work to find the right setting to have a good balance form the beginning to the end of the race. I\u2019m not so bad in braking and entry but I have some problems in other areas so we have to work. We modified the setting from Brno because in the last two races I wasn&#39;t strong enough.\u201d Crutchlow and Smith satisfied with encouraging start on home soil The biggest race of the 2013 MotoGP World Championship for Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team riders Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith got off to an encouraging start at the historic Silverstone track this afternoon. Crutchlow demonstrated his determination to be the first British rider since 2000 to finish on the podium in the British Grand Prix when he made a flying start this morning to end FP1 in third position behind current series leader Marc Marquez and reigning World Champion Jorge Lorenzo. Lap times tumbled in hotter conditions this afternoon and while home crowd hero Crutchlow was able to knock over 1.5s off his best pace, he slipped down the leaderboard into sixth, though he was less than 0.1s behind Alvaro Bautista in fourth. Roared on by a large home crowd soaking up glorious late summer sunshine, Crutchlow was hoping to be higher up the rankings and closer to the fastest pace but he is optimistic that he is yet to unleash the full potential of his YZR-M1 machine having experimented with a range of settings in both 45-minute sessions. Smith\u2019s first experience of the long and technical Silverstone layout on a MotoGP machine saw him focus on the set-up of his YZR-M1 machine to cope with super fast sections and rapid changes of direction that make the British venue one of the toughest but most spectacular challenges on the schedule. The 22-year-old was ninth fastest this morning and less than 0.3s outside of the top six and like Crutchlow he was able to make big progress in FP2. He improved from a 2.05.108 to a 2.03.750 and that major improvement promoted him into eighth on combined times and reduced the gap to the best pace to just over one second after he was able to successfully evaluate soft and hard tyre options for both the front and rear today. In both sessions Smith set his best lap on his last lap, the rookie impressively building up his speed throughout to boost his confidence that he can battle for a top six in Sunday\u2019s 20-lap race. Cal Crutchlow - Position: 6th - Time: 2.03.505 - Laps: 33 \u201cFirstly it was fantastic to see such a big crowd here at Silverstone today. The support from the British fans always gives you a boost and it was a special feeling to see so many here on the first day. It hasn\u2019t been an easy start to my home race but I am sure we can make some big improvements. This morning wasn\u2019t too bad and I was satisfied to be in the top three but it was a bit more a struggle in FP2. We were trying the bike with different settings and at the moment I\u2019ve not made a decision on which is the direction to go. I need to improve in two sectors to be faster and more competitive and one area we need to work on is front-end grip because I had too much wheelie. We will have a good look at the data tonight to make sure I\u2019m stronger tomorrow.\u201d Bradley Smith - Position: 8th - Time: 2.03.750 - Laps: 34 \u201cIt was great to ride in front of my home crowd today and the amount of people here was amazing. The British fans have always given me great support and today was no exception. It was a positive day because I found a good setting this morning and then it was a case of tweaking it to suit this track. For the first time all season I have tried all the tyre options for the front and rear in one day, so we have evaluated a lot and got a clear way to follow for the rest of the weekend. This track is certainly designed for MotoGP. It is so fast and open that you really get to explore the bike\u2019s full potential. I will enjoy riding the YZR-M1 this weekend and as I get faster I am sure it will be even more fun.\u201d  #yamaha #yamaharacing  #motogp  #valentinorossi  #jorgelorenzo  #calcrutchlow  #bradleysmith  #monsterenergy  #monster #UK #Silverstone  #motogp2013  #jl99  #vr46  #MotoGPUK", "replyCount": 0, "cleanContent": "Superb Start for Lorenzo at Silverstone Defending world champion Jorge Lorenzo made a strong start to this weekend\u2019s British Grand Prix at Silverstone in today\u2019s two free practice sessions.

For the first time all season I have tried all the tyre options for the front and rear in one day, so we have evaluated a lot and got a clear way to follow for the rest of the weekend. This track is certainly designed for MotoGP. It is so fast and open that you really get to explore the bike\u2019s full potential. I will enjoy riding the YZR-M1 this weekend and as I get faster I am sure it will be even more fun.\u201d #yamaha #yamaharacing #motogp #valentinorossi #jorgelorenzo #calcrutchlow #bradleysmith #monsterenergy #monster #UK #Silverstone #motogp2013 #jl99 #vr46 #MotoGPUK", "sentiment_score": 0.10265229110512131, "postID": "z13ycpf5xmvey3iyz04cdbuiywi0xrgxw34"}

Reigning world champion Lorenzo made an incredible start from fifth on the grid, out dragging the entire front row to take the hole-shot into turn one. Although initially able to build a gap of just over a second, he soon had rivals Marc Marquez and Dani Pedrosa close behind in pursuit. Lorenzo was able to hold off the attack and continue leading the race until just seven laps remained. Marquez\u2019s first pass proved a failure with Lorenzo able to get back round the outside of the attacker and regain the front heading up the hill. The next attack came in the last corner with just four laps remaining, Marquez squeezing through for the lead. A lap later Pedrosa was to follow, Lorenzo then tucking in behind the two to secure third on the podium, just 2.2 seconds from winner Marquez. Rossi\u2019s race proved to be a very similar experience to Indianapolis last weekend. Holding seventh from the line he was fairly quickly able to pass Bradley Smith for sixth as the first laps passed. Satellite Yamaha rider Cal Crutchlow was soon to fall in front, promoting Rossi to fifth as he began a race long battle with Alvaro Bautista. The nine-time world champion would prove to be the victor, making the crucial pass stick as the last lap wound down, taking fourth position at the line. Lorenzo\u2019s podium finish keeps him in third position in the world standings, 18 points behind Pedrosa in second. Teammate Rossi stays in fourth in standings on 143 points, six behind his teammate. The team now move straight to the Silverstone in the UK for the third of the back-to-back races, The British Grand Prix. Jorge Lorenzo 3rd \u201cI think I did my best start in all my career in MotoGP, I took four positions and in the first laps I was really quick. Finally I couldn\u2019t keep the same distance to second place so little by little they caught me. Especially under braking and on the straights they were faster than me so I couldn&#39;t do much more. I was a little nervous when the white flag came out because it\u2019s really dangerous to race with slick tyres on little spots of rain but luckily it didn&#39;t come so we could finish in dry conditions. Finally when Dani overtook me it was too far to fight back, I didn&#39;t have the rear tyre or physical condition after pushing a lot all the race. The Championship is not lost yet but it\u2019s very difficult now. We need just a few tenths to win the race so we have to pray for that at Silverstone!\u201d Valentino Rossi 4th \u201cToday was better than Indy, especially because my disadvantage to the top is half. I wanted to do better; we have to try to do better. The first three guys are impressive, very strong; I want to stay closer to them. Unfortunately I was ten seconds back, another fourth place but I want to be closer so we have to work. We tried to improve this type of setting in the last two races but it looks like it\u2019s not fantastic. Also today I suffered a bit too much at the beginning of the race. We won\u2019t give up and we will try next week to make a better job.\u201d  Crutchlow and Smith leave Brno empty handed Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team duo Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith\u2019s Czech Republic MotoGP race didn\u2019t live up to expectations after both fell out of top six contention in cool and cloudy conditions at the Brno track this afternoon. Confident he could battle for a fifth podium of 2013 after a memorable qualifying performance put Crutchlow in pole position for the second time in his MotoGP career, the 27-year-old was locked in an exciting battle with Valentino Rossi and Alvaro Bautista in the early laps. The three-way fight was a repeat of a similar exciting tussle one week ago at the legendary Indianapolis Motor Speedway and a determined Crutchlow led the way until he tumbled out of fourth position on lap eight. The British rider was able to rejoin the 22-lap race and demonstrating the never-give-up attitude that has become his trademark in MotoGP, he fought through from the back of the field to take 17th at the chequered flag. Smith was also optimistic that he could battle for a top six result after he too impressed with an outstanding qualifying performance yesterday. The rookie equalled his best grid position in sixth and he was running a strong pace right behind nine-times World Champion Valentino Rossi in front of a massive crowd of just over 142,000 fans. Feeling comfortable and confident after improving his pace on a full fuel tank in practice, Smith\u2019s challenge was ended prematurely when he crashed at Turn 9 while occupying seventh. Today\u2019s race might not have had the outcome Crutchlow and Smith had hoped for, but both have once again demonstrated their high potential in Brno and the British pair are now eagerly anticipating a return to form in front of their home fans at Silverstone next Sunday. Cal Crutchlow 17th \u201cObviously I am disappointed after qualifying in pole position but I had to push really hard to try and get away from Bautista and Rossi. Lorenzo made an incredible start and his first lap was really strong and that put us all under pressure. I was happy with my pace and I felt comfortable but then I made a mistake. I was trying to get myself back in contention for the podium and I lost the front. I am sure I could have finished fourth but I got back on a damaged bike and set a fast and consistent pace and I never gave up. It is not the best preparation for my home race at Silverstone but I go there knowing I have the pace and that I can be challenging at the front. I am really excited for Silverstone and I know the support from the British fans will be incredible, so hopefully I can give them something to cheer about.\u201d Bradley Smith DNF \u201cThe race ended far too soon and it is not the way we wanted a positive weekend to end. I don\u2019t feel I did anything different in that corner and I felt comfortable and the bike felt very good. The improvements we made on a full fuel tank made the bike much better in the early part of the race but I got caught out in Turn 9. The data showed I accelerated a fraction earlier and those small margins can make all the difference. Unfortunately the handlebar was broken so I couldn\u2019t get back in the race. But in my rookie season this can happen when you are pushing to try and learn and build experience. At least I don\u2019t have to wait long for Silverstone. I\u2019m disappointed with today but highly motivated to build on the positive points we gained here. Racing at home is always special but this will be my first MotoGP race at Silverstone and I can\u2019t wait.\u201d  #yamaha #yamaharacing #motogp #valentinorossi #jorgelorenzo #calcrutchlow #bradleysmith #monsterenergy #monster #Czech #brno #motogp2013 #jl99 #vr46", "replyCount": 1, "cleanContent": "Lorenzo Battles for Brno Podium Yamaha Factory Racing\u2019s Jorge Lorenzo fought hard today to take third on the podium for the Grand Prix of the Czech Republic with teammate Valentino Rossi taking fourth.

The 23 year old Australian not only celebrated his first FIM Motocross World Championship victory but dominated the weekend on his YZ250F with Pole Position and wins in both MX2 motos. 19,000 spectators entered a temperate and cloudy Bastogne for the fifteenth round of seventeen in the current campaign. It was the site for the seventh podium result for YZ250F technology this year and Yamaha\u2019s first triumph in 2013. The tree-lined Sans Souci layout presented a quick and rutty course with the fine soil producing a slick and \u2018attackable\u2019 surface. Occasional showers partially helped soften the terrain, contain the dust and alternate areas of grip. Ferris collected his second Pole Position of the season with a good start and duel with world champion Jeffrey Herlings on Saturday. When the Dutchman crashed and subsequently ruled himself out of the meeting with a dislocated shoulder Ferris eased to the top spot and first pick in the gate. The first Grand Prix moto saw all four Monster Energy Yamahas circulating in the top five as Maxime Desprey aced the holeshot and led the first three-quarters of the distance. The French rookie was unable to keep Ferris at bay until the chequered flag however and dropped back to (still) a career-best fourth place. Christophe Charlier was a solid third for three YZ250F in the first four slots. Misfortune for European Champion Mel Pocock who crashed out of the leading sect and had to retire with a damaged machine. The Brit then also had to stop in the second affair after becoming involved in a first turn pile-up. With Ferris already toasting a first \u201925 points\u2019 the Aussie confidently strode away in the second race after dealing with the early attentions of Glen Coldenhoff. In a faultless and controlled run \u2018111\u2019 made sure of his achievement in some style. Charlier did not have the edge of speed that he displayed earlier in the day and a fall ruined his momentum. He crossed the line in seventh place \u2013 for sixth overall \u2013 and just in front of Desprey \u2013 seventh overall for a very strong weekend - to stay in touch for the battle for third place in the MX2 Championship. The MX2 class title might have already been won but the final podium positions are still up for grabs and Charlier current stands 4th on 439 points and 31 from Jose Butron with 100 left to win. Ferris is 6th and only 3 away from Coldenhoff in 5th. Mel Pocock holds 13th while Desprey retains 16th. The FIM Motocross World Championship will speed into its final phases in the coming three weeks with Grands Prix in Great Britain and Holland bringing the calendar to a close before the 67th Motocross of Nations (with Christophe Charlier and Dean Ferris both set to represent their countries) taking place at Teutschenthal in Germany on September 29th. Dean Ferris \u201cIt was a perfect weekend really and it was key to get two good starts here which is what I did. The first moto was tough and it took me a long time to get around my team-mate. My goggles were finished and as soon as I passed him I threw them off and that was a relief for me. I clocked out some good lap-times and controlled the race. In the second moto I immediately passed Coldenhoff and we jostled for the lead a little bit until I could drop the hammer and make a gap of around seven seconds. I managed that the whole way and nothing crazy happened and I didn\u2019t make any mistakes. The track seemed to suit me both days. When Jeffrey [Herlings, world champion] went home last night I think all of the guys in MX2 thought they would give it a really good go today and I\u2019m proud that I took both motos. I\u2019ve won a GP now so the \u2018monkey is off the back\u2019 and I think the Matterley Basin track up next will be good for me. I haven\u2019t raced there but was a spectator in 2011 and there are plenty of ruts and hopefully I can carry this form into next weekend. It is special that we broke the KTM streak in the class and gave Yamaha our first win of the season, so I\u2019m also proud of that. I am one of four Australians to be on a GP podium and also to win and to be in the record books with Reed, McFarlane and Leisk is pretty special. At the beginning of the year I had a goal of winning a grand prix. I knew I\u2019d be super-stoked if it happened and I\u2019m pumped that I actually got one.\u201d Christophe Charlier \u201cIn the first race I had a good start and worked towards a solid third. I had to fight to fourth in the second moto but then had a crash. I found it difficult to pass the other riders and keep my rhythm. I lost what points I gained in the first moto but racing can go like this. I am now focussed on what I have to do next week in England. Everything is still possible in this championship.\u201d Maxime Desprey \u201cThis was my best Grand Prix yet. In the first race I took the holeshot and I was first for around twenty-five minutes; it was pretty crazy! I tried not to make any mistakes but near the end it was a bit more difficult with a lot of pressure from the guys behind. Anyway I finished fourth and that\u2019s my best result. In the second race my start wasn\u2019t so bad and I was behind Tixier for a long time. I tried to pass him but started to get a bit tired by the end. The whole weekend was a good learning experience and I\u2019m happy.\u201d #MX #MX2  #yamaha  #monsteryamaha  #yamaharacing  #monsterenergy  #deanferris  #australia  #yz250f  #belgiumgp  #belgium", "replyCount": 0, "cleanContent": "Historic first win and perfect weekend for Ferris Monster Energy Yamaha\u2019s Dean Ferris will remember the 2013 Grand Prix of Belgium for a long time.

When Jeffrey [Herlings, world champion] went home last night I think all of the guys in MX2 thought they would give it a really good go today and I\u2019m proud that I took both motos. I\u2019ve won a GP now so the \u2018monkey is off the back\u2019 and I think the Matterley Basin track up next will be good for me. I haven\u2019t raced there but was a spectator in 2011 and there are plenty of ruts and hopefully I can carry this form into next weekend. It is special that we broke the KTM streak in the class and gave Yamaha our first win of the season, so I\u2019m also proud of that. I am one of four Australians to be on a GP podium and also to win and to be in the record books with Reed, McFarlane and Leisk is pretty special. At the beginning of the year I had a goal of winning a grand prix. I knew I\u2019d be super-stoked if it happened and I\u2019m pumped that I actually got one.\u201d Christophe Charlier \u201cIn the first race I had a good start and worked towards a solid third. I had to fight to fourth in the second moto but then had a crash. I found it difficult to pass the other riders and keep my rhythm. I lost what points I gained in the first moto but racing can go like this. I am now focussed on what I have to do next week in England. Everything is still possible in this championship.\u201d Maxime Desprey \u201cThis was my best Grand Prix yet. In the first race I took the holeshot and I was first for around twenty-five minutes; it was pretty crazy! I tried not to make any mistakes but near the end it was a bit more difficult with a lot of pressure from the guys behind. Anyway I finished fourth and that\u2019s my best result. In the second race my start wasn\u2019t so bad and I was behind Tixier for a long time. I tried to pass him but started to get a bit tired by the end. The whole weekend was a good learning experience and I\u2019m happy.\u201d #MX #MX2 #yamaha #monsteryamaha #yamaharacing #monsterenergy #deanferris #australia #yz250f #belgiumgp #belgium", "sentiment_score": 0.05758510638297873, "postID": "z12ycvsybzzfvlonn22dynrr3kbhvbj0t"}

He impressed with a stunning start from second on the grid, out dragging both Marc Marquez and Dani Pedrosa to take the hole-shot into turn one. Lorenzo immediately built a half second gap and managed to hold the lead on a track not best suited to the Yamaha until Marquez squeezed past with 15 laps to go. Marques was not allowed to break away and Lorenzo kept with him until fatigue set in as the race wound down and he was forced to relinquish second to Pedrosa with three laps remaining. This important podium whilst still recovering from surgery allows Lorenzo to now return to European tracks favoured by the YZR-M1 in full fitness and just 15 points behind Pedrosa in third on 153 points. Teammate Valentino Rossi\u2019s race proved to be the opposite of Lorenzo\u2019s. The Italian nine-time world champion spent the early part of the race fighting with a less than perfect set up as he made up ground from his ninth position start on the grid. Nicky Hayden was dispatched on the second lap for eighth and fellow Yamaha rider Bradley Smith would follow. With just six laps remaining it was clear Rossi had saved the best for last, hunting down Alvaro Bautista and Cal Crutchlow who were fighting for fourth. Rossi joined the battle, swapping positions repeatedly until a stunning pass on the second to last corner of the last lap saw him steal fourth from Crutchlow and hold it to the line. The result keeps Rossi in fourth in the overall standings with 130 points, three clear of Crutchlow in fourth. Rossi and the team will now head directly to Brno for the second of three consecutive back-to-back races. Jorge Lorenzo 3rd \u201cI made a very good start and I had half a second advantage in the beginning of the race. I had a lot of hope because I knew I had a good pace but suddenly in the middle of the race Marc started to go faster and faster so it was impossible to win. I\u2019m disappointed to not finish second, because in normal conditions without the drop in rear tyre this would have been possible. I\u2019m happy to be back on the podium at a track that\u2019s not normally a good one for us. I don\u2019t feel perfect, I feel more tired than normal because I haven\u2019t trained so much in the last two months because of the injuries. I felt tired at the end of the race and had some pain in the braking areas but I feel much better and in Brno and Silverstone I will be ok. I think from this moment we can only be better and better.\u201d Valentino Rossi 4th \u201cAt the end the race was not so bad, especially compared with yesterday and especially the second half. I could ride the bike in a good way and I could enjoy it. I did a very good lap time in the second half and had great battles with Bradl and Bautista, but especially with Cal on the last lap, that was very funny. Fourth place here is good considering this track is one of the worst for me and considering I started from ninth I am quite happy. We still have to work and understand why in the first laps I can\u2019t ride the bike and use the extra grip of the tyre. In the second part when the tyre slides I can enter the corner faster, I can go faster and I can make good lap times so we have to improve because the first three riders are very strong.\u201d Crutchlow fifth after late drama in Indianapolis Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow ended an intriguing Indianapolis MotoGP race in fifth position this afternoon, the British rider playing a leading role in one of the most intense battles in the 27-lap clash. Engaged in a frenetic fight for the majority of the race with Spaniard Alvaro Bautista, the tussle for fourth position became a three-way battle, with nine-times World Champion Valentino Rossi riding into contention with a brilliant late attack. All three treated a crowd of just over 60,000 fans to some breathless action, with the trio constantly exchanging overtakes before the exciting battle came right down to the final corner. Crutchlow had produced an outstanding final lap to keep Rossi and Bautista at bay and fourth position seemed to have been secured behind dominant Spanish trio Marc Marquez, Dani Pedrosa and Jorge Lorenzo. After 44 minutes of nail-biting action though there was still time for one final dramatic twist, with Rossi executing a last ditch overtake at the final corner to push Crutchlow back into fifth. Less than 0.2s split Rossi, Crutchlow and Bautista at the finish line and the crowd were on their feet to show their appreciation at witnessing such a fierce but fair fight. Bradley Smith secured his seventh top 10 finish of the season, the British rider\u2019s race starting and finishing in tremendously exciting fashion. Smith got a stunning launch off the line and on the first lap he held fourth place before he slipped back into a fight with Andrea Dovizioso and Nicky Hayden for eighth. The 22-year-old exerted constant pressure on his more experienced counterparts and his determination and hard work was rewarded when Hayden and Dovizioso ran off track at the final corner. Smith pounced on the opportunity to win a drag race to the finish line and he claimed a hard fought eighth spot by the narrowest of margins over home crowd favourite Hayden. Smith\u2019s excellent performance also elevated him into the top 10 in the World Championship standings for the first time in his rookie campaign. Cal Crutchlow 5th \u201cI\u2019m really pleased to finish the race in the top five and it means I am still the leading satellite bike in the Championship, which is an achievement to be proud of. It was a really good battle out there and I enjoyed it a lot. All of us were pushing at our absolute maximum and Alvaro rode fantastic. Credit to Valentino as well because he recovered quite a lot of time and it is not easy to do that towards the end of the race. I knew it was going to come down to the last lap and probably the last corner and I did my best to keep fourth. But unfortunately Valentino made a good move up the inside of the right before the last corner and I couldn\u2019t get him back. I had a lot of fun though I think the three of us gave the American fans something to cheer. I\u2019ve only lost two points to Valentino in the Championship on a track I don\u2019t like at all. I was strong all weekend, so that gives me a lot of confidence for the next races in Brno and Silverstone where I was very competitive at last season.\u201d Bradley Smith 8th \u201cI think eighth position was more or less what we had predicted for the race, but we did not expect to be so far behind the winner. The race was very exciting and I got an amazing start but pretty much right from the first lap I felt we had an issue with the rear end of the bike. I tried to maintain my pace but unfortunately I ran off in at Turn 6 and a few guys passed me. I tried to recover again but the rear problem was getting worse and at the end of the race I could only try to pass the Ducatis. I was a bit lucky that they ran wide in the last corner, so I could pass both on the final straight. Eighth is not a bad result but I\u2019m a little bit disappointed because we did a really good job during the whole weekend and I was very confident for the race. Now I just hope I can carry the good performances from practice and qualifying into Brno.\u201d  #MotoGP #motogp2013  #yamaha  #yamaharacing  #jl99  #vr46  #jorgelorenzo  #valentinorossi  #calcrutchlow  #monsterenergy  #monster  #yzrm1  #indinapolis  #MotoGPindi2013", "replyCount": 3, "cleanContent": "Lorenzo Takes Third in Indianapolis Thriller Reigning World Champion Jorge Lorenzo marked his return to fitness today with third in the Indianapolis Grand Prix, his fifth premier class podium finish at the US track.

The reigning world champion was on typical form for the 15 minute qualifying heat, ensuring he was the first man on track as the session began. Wasting no time, the first flying lap saw him smash the all-time record for the circuit with an impressive 1\u201938.648 second lap. Lorenzo\u2019s hold on the top spot was short lived as championship rival Marc Marquez then moved into first however he was determined to hold the front row. After a stop for a fresh rear tyre he returned to the track with six minutes to go and delivered another hot lap, dropping his time to 1\u201938.471 to secure second place on the grid for the race. Valentino Rossi endured a frustrating qualifying this afternoon, unable to find a set up with his YZR-M1 to challenge with the frontrunners. Rossi initially managed a 1\u201940.315 second lap to take ninth on his first outing before returning to the pits for fresh rubber. His second outing on track saw him improve considerably, taking a second off his time to lap in 1\u201939.356 seconds. Despite the improvement the time was not enough to move up the grid so the nine time champion will start from ninth on the third row of the grid tomorrow. Jorge Lorenzo 2nd / 1&#39;38.471 / 8 laps \u201cI\u2019m happy with the pace, it\u2019s not bad. We still don&#39;t know how well our rivals are prepared for the race but I think I have a constant pace to finish the race with a good speed. The bike has improved by some small details every session so I\u2019m happy with that also. I\u2019m happy to be back on the first row and confident we can fight for the podium. You can see that Marc, Dani and Stefan are really strong, normally we are with them but it&#39;s clear that this track is not so suitable for our bike, but it\u2019s much better than it was in 2011. I am confident that we can fight to be not far from first position or maybe to fight for first.\u201d Valentino Rossi 9th / 1&#39;39.356 / 8 laps \u201cI\u2019m disappointed because in the practice we weren\u2019t fantastic but better than we were this afternoon. Unfortunately in the fifteen minutes of the qualifying practice the other guys were able to improve more. Especially they are able to improve in braking and corner entry. Jorge did a fantastic job! I tried but when I put on the soft tyre I have more problems with the front and I cannot push a lot. I just managed to improve my time a bit from the used tyre when we had done already fifteen laps. Anyway, we have to look forward and try to improve tomorrow. My pace is nothing fantastic but it&#39;s better than 9th position so I have to try to recover some positions and make a good race.\u201d  Crutchlow and Smith confident for Brickyard battle Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team riders Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith are confident they have the speed to battle for top positions in tomorrow\u2019s MotoGP race at the historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Crutchlow narrowly missed out on clinching a fantastic fifth front row start in the 2013 campaign and he will start the 27-lap race from fourth position on the grid. The 27-year-old clocked a best time of 1.38.502 that looked to have secured him a fourth front row in the last five races, only for Spaniard Dani Pedrosa to bump him out of third spot by just 0.017s in the closing moments of QP2. Crutchlow remains optimistic that he can battle with Spanish trio Marc Marquez, Jorge Lorenzo and Pedrosa in tomorrow\u2019s race, as he goes in search of a fifth rostrum of the season to strengthen his Championship challenge. Rookie Smith\u2019s outstanding qualifying form continued in hot conditions this afternoon, the 22-year-old securing a top 10 position on the grid for the fourth consecutive race. Smith, who starts tomorrow\u2019s race looking to move into the top 10 in the World Championship standings, set a best time of 1.39.255 that at one stage looked set to secure him a place on the second row for only the second time this season. Today\u2019s result though further underlined Smith\u2019s growing experience and confidence with his Monster Yamaha Tech 3 YZR-M1 machinery and he was able claim the notable scalps of Stefan Bradl and Valentino Rossi\u2019s in this afternoon&#39;s 15-minute session. Cal Crutchlow 4th 1.38.502 \u2013 8 laps \u201cI am a little bit disappointed not to be on front row because I\u2019ve been inside the top three for most of the weekend. The positive point though is I am much stronger than in the past here at Indianapolis and I am looking forward to the race. I\u2019ve returned from the summer break and picked up where I left off in the first half of the Championship and a podium is not out of the question tomorrow. Congratulations to Marc though because he has been in awesome form all weekend and he produced another incredible lap in qualifying. Hopefully we can put up a fight against him but we still have to work more on the set-up and at the moment I haven\u2019t decided which tyre I will race.\u201d Bradley Smith 7th 1.39.255 \u2013 8 laps \u201cI am happy to be on the third row because we made a really good improvement with the bike today. I did my best lap on my own and then I tried to follow Cal to improve a bit more but I made a small mistake. We\u2019ve done a great job improving my feeling with a full fuel tank and this gives me a lot of confidence for the race, particularly in the first eight laps. I will be looking to make a good start and seeing what I can learn from those guys in front of me. Being precise and consistent is also going to be crucial at this track. It is easy to run off and if you do get off line it is very dirty, so making the least number of mistakes as possible will be crucial.\u201d #yamaha #yamaharacing  #motogp  #motogp2013  #jl99  #jorgelorenzo  #vr46  #valentinorossi  #monster  #monsterenergy  #calcrutchlow  #usa  #indianapolis", "replyCount": 3, "cleanContent": "Lorenzo Back on the Front Row at the Brickyard Yamaha Factory Racing\u2019s Jorge Lorenzo scored a front row position with second place in this afternoon\u2019s qualifying for tomorrow\u2019s Indianapolis Grand Prix.

The Italian made a strong start from fourth on the grid to take second into turn one, tucking in behind race leader Stefan Bradl. The nine-time world champion fought hard to maintain his pace but was forced to concede second to Marc Marquez on lap four following a dramatic overtake into the Corkscrew turn. With fourth place rider Alvaro Bautista closing Rossi then worked hard to hold off the Spaniard to retain his third place and podium finish. Jorge Lorenzo successfully completed his weekend of damage limitation with an exhausting ride to sixth place. Still physically compromised following his two surgeries to his collarbone the Laguna race proved to be a big challenge for the world champion. Starting from sixth on the grid he initially made up two places to fourth, diving inside Dani Pedrosa on turn one for position. The race became a war of attrition for Lorenzo, battling to stay focused for the 32lap stint, eventually bringing it home in sixth place after a testing ride. The podium finish leaves Rossi on 117 points in the standings in fourth position, 20points behind teammate Lorenzo. Lorenzo holds on to third place, now on 137 points, ten behind Pedrosa in second. The teams now take an extended break before returning to the USA for Indianapolis Grand Prix on Sunday 18th August. Valentino Rossi 3rd \u201cAt this track with the Yamaha we suffer a little more than the Hondas, but we worked very well in the practice, we tried everything and I could keep a good pace in the race until the end, not far from Bradl. I fought with Bautista but always stayed in front so I could take the third podium in a row. I am quite competitive and I am happy, it is a good result. Now we take some rest, we go on holiday and we try to take some rest for the second half of the season. Regarding the pass, I tried to resist but today wasn&#39;t the right day, Marc was too strong for me.

I felt quite dizzy from the middle of the race to the end so my performance was getting worse. The bike was also not working the same as in warm up. Maybe with more temperature the tyres were working differently and I couldn&#39;t stop the same in the braking zones so I didn&#39;t have the same feeling and I was half a second slower. The important thing is that we saved a very dangerous situation because if I crashed again I might have finished my championship. We have one month to rest and train now to get back in shape which will be important for Indianapolis. I hope to be in almost perfect condition there and have the same performance as before the crash.\u201d Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow rode to a hard fought seventh place finish in today\u2019s US MotoGP round at a sun-kissed Laguna Seca. The British rider displayed the fighting spirit he has become famous for throughout an energy-sapping 32-lap race, but he was unable to make any impression on the top six despite pushing to his absolute maximum from start to finish. The 27-year-old, who was seeking to become the first British rider since the legendary Barry Sheene to score three successive podium finishes in the premier class, exerted tremendous early pressure on Jorge Lorenzo and Dani Pedrosa to break into the top six. The Spanish duo showed just why they are consistent World Championship contenders, with both refusing to buckle under Crutchlow\u2019s intense pressure and rather than take unnecessary risks, Crutchlow opted to settle for a seventh position that keeps him close to the battle for the top three in the overall rankings. Today\u2019s race, which marked the halfway stage of the 2013 MotoGP World Championship, ended in disappointing fashion for rookie Bradley Smith. The 22-year-old had quickly settled into a fast rhythm in front of a crowd of over 46,000 fans and a top eight finish on his Laguna Seca debut looked comfortably within his grasp. Smith was sizing up where he could overtake Nicky Hayden and Andrea Dovizioso later in the race when he was denied a seventh successive top 10 finish by a small technical issue with his Monster Yamaha YZR-M1 machine at the end of lap eight. The Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team now embarks on a well deserved summer break before the exciting 2013 World Championship campaign resumes with a third visit to America at the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Cal Crutchlow 5th \u201cThat was a difficult end to a very difficult weekend and in all honesty I never got comfortable with the bike at any stage here. It is my worst result of the season so far and I can\u2019t be happy because I gave up some valuable points in the Championship. Maybe last year in the same situation I would have pushed and not finished, so that is one positive we can take from what was a tough weekend and it certainly isn\u2019t how I wanted to go into the summer break. Right from the start of the race I was on the limit and couldn\u2019t go any faster. I got beat fair and square and the three on the podium definitely deserved it. I tried my best and didn\u2019t give up but sometimes you have to accept you can\u2019t do any better. It has been a pretty hectic month so now I am looking forward to getting some rest and I will be back even more motivated in Indianapolis.\u201d Bradley Smith DNF \u201cIt is a shame that my race was ended by a technical problem today because my bike has been faultless all year. This can happen at any stage but unfortunately it happened in the race and now we will carry out a thorough investigation to find out what happened. Sometimes these things can happen and it was a shame because I was looking at finishing inside the top eight and that would have been a positive result. The race was going well and I was confident after being very strong in the warm-up because we made a good step with the bike. But then I had the problem and I have to accept that this is part of racing. The first half of the season has been very enjoyable and I have learned so much. I am feeling I am making big progress and now the summer break gives me the opportunity to rest my recovering left wrist and I can focus on coming back much stronger physically in Indianapolis.\u201d #yamaha #yamaharacing #motogp #motogp2013 #valentinorossi #vr46 #jl99 #jorgelorenzo #calcrutchlow #lagunaseca #usa", "replyCount": 1, "cleanContent": "Third Consecutive Podium for Rossi in Laguna Battle Yamaha Factory Racing\u2019s Valentino Rossi delivered his third consecutive podium of the 2013 MotoGP season today with third place in the US Grand Prix.

The quick fire qualifying heat gathered pace as the clock wound down, with the top five positions constantly changing as the fast times came in. Rossi\u2019s first flying lap put him initially in third before a burst of activity saw him drop several places. The Italian came in to pit for fresh rubber with eight minutes remaining then re-joined the time attack, climbing to second place with just over three minutes to go with a 1\u201921.418. The times then dropped a little more, leaving the nine-time champion on the second row in fourth, just 0.045 seconds from the front row and 0.242 from pole. Lorenzo continued his careful approach to the weekend today, gradually building speed whilst focusing on minimising any risk of damage to his freshly broken collarbone. The world champion was one of the first riders out in qualifying, recording a 1\u201922.589 before dropping down the timesheets a little as the lap times tumbled. He dropped under the 1\u201922 mark with his second lap before returning to the pits for fresh rubber. He returned to the track with just over six minutes to go and joined the fight for the front row. He was able to improve again, recording a 1\u201921.453 to take sixth on the grid just 0.277 seconds from pole. Valentino Rossi 4th / 1&#39;21.418 / 9 laps \u201cI\u2019m quite happy about my position on the grid because I did quite a good lap. Unfortunately I lost the first row but I\u2019m fourth and not so far. We worked a lot on the bike, especially after some laps when the tyre starts to slide. We made some improvements but it\u2019s not enough. I\u2019m quite worried as we have to find a way tomorrow to be a bit stronger and a bit faster, especially after some laps. We have to work to improve, so we have something to do, but starting in the top four is good as starting in the front is important here.\u201d Jorge Lorenzo 6th / 1&#39;21.453 / 9 laps \u201cI felt better physically in qualifying than in the last free practice so I pushed a lot and made some good laps. Maybe I could do one or two tenths faster with a perfect lap and be in the first row but the position is ok. When I saw my lap times I hoped to stay third or fourth but the other riders improved their lap times from the free practice. They are so close, if I could improve one tenth I could be on the front row and with two tenths I could be in pole position. The important thing is I didn&#39;t crash and maybe tomorrow will be even better. It&#39;s a very hard track, almost all the braking zones are not completely straight so I struggle on the shoulder. It&#39;s a very long race with 32 laps so maybe with some painkillers I can be better than at Assen.&quot; Monster Yamaha Tech3 Team riders Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith will start inside the top 10 on the grid together for the third race in succession after a tense and exciting qualifying battle at the spectacular Laguna Seca track this afternoon. An eventful afternoon for Crutchlow began when the on form British rider recovered from a heavy fall at Turn 3 to finish third quickest in FP4. Confident he had the speed to secure a fourth consecutive front row start in the 15-minute QP2, the 27-year-old\u2019s second YZR-M1 machine encountered a minor technical problem that prevented him from taking to the track with the rest of the field. His Monster Yamaha Tech 3 crew were able to rectify the issue and Crutchlow was quickly able to make up for lost time and put up a tremendous fight for a fifth front row start of the campaign. He clocked a personal best lap of 1.21.420 that was only 0.047s away from the top three and tomorrow\u2019s 32-lap race promises to be an epic battle with the top six split by just 0.277s in a closely contested qualifying session. Smith\u2019s seventh successive top 10 position in qualifying was a great reward for the hard work and effort his Monster Yamaha Tech 3 crew have been putting in to help him feel comfortable and confident on the tight and technically challenging California track. Smith has made excellent progress throughout his first experience of the US Grand Prix and his best time of 1.22.075 was almost 0.7s faster than he\u2019d managed earlier in the weekend. He finished just 0.899s off pole position and he has been able to set an impressive pace in full race trim throughout the weekend, raising expectations for another positive result in tomorrow\u2019s race. Cal Crutchlow 5th 1.21.420 \u2013 7 laps : \u201cToday has been a tough day, so still to be on the second row of the grid is not too bad considering what has happened. I crashed on my first lap out of the pits in FP4 and we need to check the front tyre because I wasn\u2019t even pushing. It was strange but we will sit down and analyse the data with Bridgestone to identify what happened. Unfortunately the bike couldn\u2019t be repaired in time and we had a small technical problem with the second bike at the start of QP2. We are still checking to see what happened but it meant I only really got one flying lap in. I am fifth and very close to the front row but it is still my worst qualifying result of the season and it is a bit disappointing. But I am optimistic for the race. The times are incredibly close and as always the goal will be to fight for the podium.\u201d Bradley Smith 9th 1.22.075 \u2013 10 laps : \u201cI am very happy with the improvement in my lap times all weekend. To do a 1.22.0 was a great step and I have to say a big thanks to my Monster Yamaha Tech 3 crew because they did a brilliant job in improving the bike. I felt we had been going round in circles with the set-up a little bit but the bike felt great in QP2 and we really made a big step. This is not an easy track and tomorrow\u2019s race is going to be really tough over 32-laps. It is always crucial to get a good start but tomorrow it will be essential because I believe I can learn a lot in the race. If I can find another couple of tenths from myself then I can stay in a fight and gain a lot of experience and that\u2019s what I need more than anything. I am happy with my race pace and I am looking forward to the race.\u201d #yamaha #yamaharacing  #motogp  #motogp2013  #valentinorossi  #vr46  #jl99  #jorgelorenzo  #calcrutchlow  #lagunaseca  #usa", "replyCount": 0, "cleanContent": "Rossi and Lorenzo Score Second Row for Laguna Seca Yamaha Factory Racing riders Valentino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo battled through one of the most hectic qualifying sessions of the season today to take fourth and sixth respectively on the grid for tomorrow\u2019s US Grand Prix at Laguna Seca.

The times then dropped a little more, leaving the nine-time champion on the second row in fourth, just 0.045 seconds from the front row and 0.242 from pole. Lorenzo continued his careful approach to the weekend today, gradually building speed whilst focusing on minimising any risk of damage to his freshly broken collarbone. The world champion was one of the first riders out in qualifying, recording a 1\u201922.589 before dropping down the timesheets a little as the lap times tumbled. He dropped under the 1\u201922 mark with his second lap before returning to the pits for fresh rubber. He returned to the track with just over six minutes to go and joined the fight for the front row. He was able to improve again, recording a 1\u201921.453 to take sixth on the grid just 0.277 seconds from pole. Valentino Rossi 4th / 1'21.418 / 9 laps \u201cI\u2019m quite happy about my position on the grid because I did quite a good lap. Unfortunately I lost the first row but I\u2019m fourth and not so far. We worked a lot on the bike, especially after some laps when the tyre starts to slide. We made some improvements but it\u2019s not enough. I\u2019m quite worried as we have to find a way tomorrow to be a bit stronger and a bit faster, especially after some laps. We have to work to improve, so we have something to do, but starting in the top four is good as starting in the front is important here.\u201d Jorge Lorenzo 6th / 1'21.453 / 9 laps \u201cI felt better physically in qualifying than in the last free practice so I pushed a lot and made some good laps. Maybe I could do one or two tenths faster with a perfect lap and be in the first row but the position is ok. When I saw my lap times I hoped to stay third or fourth but the other riders improved their lap times from the free practice. They are so close, if I could improve one tenth I could be on the front row and with two tenths I could be in pole position. The important thing is I didn't crash and maybe tomorrow will be even better. It's a very hard track, almost all the braking zones are not completely straight so I struggle on the shoulder. It's a very long race with 32 laps so maybe with some painkillers I can be better than at Assen.\" Monster Yamaha Tech3 Team riders Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith will start inside the top 10 on the grid together for the third race in succession after a tense and exciting qualifying battle at the spectacular Laguna Seca track this afternoon. An eventful afternoon for Crutchlow began when the on form British rider recovered from a heavy fall at Turn 3 to finish third quickest in FP4. Confident he had the speed to secure a fourth consecutive front row start in the 15-minute QP2, the 27-year-old\u2019s second YZR-M1 machine encountered a minor technical problem that prevented him from taking to the track with the rest of the field. His Monster Yamaha Tech 3 crew were able to rectify the issue and Crutchlow was quickly able to make up for lost time and put up a tremendous fight for a fifth front row start of the campaign. He clocked a personal best lap of 1.21.420 that was only 0.047s away from the top three and tomorrow\u2019s 32-lap race promises to be an epic battle with the top six split by just 0.277s in a closely contested qualifying session. Smith\u2019s seventh successive top 10 position in qualifying was a great reward for the hard work and effort his Monster Yamaha Tech 3 crew have been putting in to help him feel comfortable and confident on the tight and technically challenging California track. Smith has made excellent progress throughout his first experience of the US Grand Prix and his best time of 1.22.075 was almost 0.7s faster than he\u2019d managed earlier in the weekend. He finished just 0.899s off pole position and he has been able to set an impressive pace in full race trim throughout the weekend, raising expectations for another positive result in tomorrow\u2019s race. Cal Crutchlow 5th 1.21.420 \u2013 7 laps : \u201cToday has been a tough day, so still to be on the second row of the grid is not too bad considering what has happened. I crashed on my first lap out of the pits in FP4 and we need to check the front tyre because I wasn\u2019t even pushing. It was strange but we will sit down and analyse the data with Bridgestone to identify what happened. Unfortunately the bike couldn\u2019t be repaired in time and we had a small technical problem with the second bike at the start of QP2. We are still checking to see what happened but it meant I only really got one flying lap in. I am fifth and very close to the front row but it is still my worst qualifying result of the season and it is a bit disappointing. But I am optimistic for the race. The times are incredibly close and as always the goal will be to fight for the podium.\u201d Bradley Smith 9th 1.22.075 \u2013 10 laps : \u201cI am very happy with the improvement in my lap times all weekend. To do a 1.22.0 was a great step and I have to say a big thanks to my Monster Yamaha Tech 3 crew because they did a brilliant job in improving the bike. I felt we had been going round in circles with the set-up a little bit but the bike felt great in QP2 and we really made a big step. This is not an easy track and tomorrow\u2019s race is going to be really tough over 32-laps. It is always crucial to get a good start but tomorrow it will be essential because I believe I can learn a lot in the race. If I can find another couple of tenths from myself then I can stay in a fight and gain a lot of experience and that\u2019s what I need more than anything. I am happy with my race pace and I am looking forward to the race.\u201d #yamaha #yamaharacing #motogp #motogp2013 #valentinorossi #vr46 #jl99 #jorgelorenzo #calcrutchlow #lagunaseca #usa", "sentiment_score": 0.06470994248151192, "postID": "z12uwjxyurncwzzls22dynrr3kbhvbj0t"}

Today\u2019s podium finish is his first at the Sachsenring circuit since his victory with Yamaha in 2009 and is a mark of his continued return to form following his Assen victory two weeks ago. Starting from third on the grid the nine-time World Champion took the hole shot into turn one and led local German rider Stefan Bradl into the first lap. As Rossi struggled to find grip from the rear Bradl was able to pass on turn 12. As the laps wound down pole man Marc Marquez squeezed for the lead. Rossi was able to pick up the pace again with 22 laps to go, re-passing Bradl for second position. Mid-race distance saw tyre wear drop dramatically and with 15 laps remaining Rossi was forced to allow satellite Yamaha rider Cal Crutchlow to pass. Despite the lack of grip he was able to build a gap of nearly 4 seconds to Bradl in fourth to secure third place and a second successive podium finish of the season. The result puts Rossi on 101 Championship points, six behind Crutchlow in fourth. Teammate Jorge Lorenzo now sits in third position in the Championship on 127 points having missed the race through injury. Despite the set back he is just 11 points behind leader Marquez. No decision has yet been made for Lorenzo\u2019s participation in the Laguna Seca race as he recovers from yesterday\u2019s collarbone surgery in Barcelona. His team will travel to the USA and set up as normal should the reigning World Champion decide to ride in next weekend\u2019s Grand Prix. Valentino Rossi 3rd / +9.620 \u201cIt&#39;s a good result, to stay on the podium is always a good result but I expected something more and to do a better race. During the weekend we made some choices, yesterday we decided to set up the bike in one way and today after some laps I started to suffer too much. The first ten laps were not so bad but after I started to have problems and it was too difficult to turn the bike, especially on the left I was sliding too much. We have to work to try and make another step to stay with the top guys. Next we will have Laguna, a very special track, and we will try to have better results there. We are five very fast riders and we are closer now because unfortunately Dani and Jorge are injured and we have another race next week. If I want to fight for the Championship I have to go faster and I have to be constantly faster so I have to make another step.\u201d Crutchlow and Smith equal season best in Germany Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith equalled their season best results at Germany\u2019s Sachsenring today, the British duo storming to a fantastic double top six finish for the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team. Crutchlow raced to an outstanding fourth podium in the last five races to continue his amazing record-breaking exploits in the 2013 World Championship, while Smith showed tremendous speed and consistency to secure a second top six finish in his rookie campaign. On form Crutchlow produced a scintillating surge through the field after he\u2019d been dropped back to sixth in a frenetic opening to the 30-lap race. The 27-year-old\u2019s brilliant charge gathered momentum on lap four when he dived underneath Alvaro Bautista to slot into fourth at the final corner. He then pressured home crowd favourite Stefan Bradl into a mistake at the final corner on lap 10 to move into the top three. With adrenaline and the non-stop action taking his mind of numerous cuts, bruises and friction burns he suffered in two heavy practice crashes, he then executed a brave but perfect pass on Valentino Rossi at Turn 12 on lap 16 to snatch second. At that stage of the race, Marc Marquez had established a comfortable advantage of 2.8s. But demonstrating his never give up attitude and fighting spirit, Crutchlow launched a relentless pursuit of the Spaniard that kept fans on the edge of their seats right to the chequered flag. Crutchlow narrowed the gap to 1.5s but Marquez was unflappable, though Crutchlow\u2019s second place helped him secure another personal milestone in his third premier class season. Today&#39;s result saw him become the first British rider to score four or more podium MotoGP finishes since the legendary Barry Sheene in 1982. Not be to be outdone, Smith\u2019s eye-catching ride ensured he played an important role in a landmark result, with today\u2019s race the first time two British riders have finished inside the top six in a premier class encounter since the Donington Park round back 1993. Starting from seventh on the grid, the 22-year-old held onto that place while he was comfortably able to streak away from a chasing pack that included MotoGP race winners Andrea Dovizioso and Nicky Hayden. He moved into the top six on lap seven and feeling comfortable and confident on the YZR-M1 machine he pushed hard to try and bridge a gap of close to three seconds to Bautista in fifth. He kept the Spaniard firmly in his sights throughout the race but was happy to settle for a richly deserved top six. The most pleasing aspect for the rookie was the 25-second gap to race winner Marquez, which was the closest Smith has finished to first place in 2013, and provides further proof of his rapidly growing confidence with the YZR-M1 machine. Cal Crutchlow 2nd\u2013 107 points : \u201cI am really happy to be on the podium again because it was a hard race in my physical condition. The two crashes in practice took a lot out of me but I dug deep and it is great to get another podium for the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team. I actually made a really good start but I had to roll off the throttle when Marc came towards me and that cost me a few places. The bike worked really well in the first few laps and I was able to fight my way through and I really enjoyed it. In the second half of the race the bike felt great and I was fast. I came on strong and pulled away from Valentino and I did absolutely everything I could to close down Marc. I couldn\u2019t have done anything more but credit to him because he didn\u2019t make a mistake, he controlled the gap to me very well and he deserved to win. I just kept on pushing and at the end second is another fantastic result. It is my fourth podium and I am not so far back in the Championship, so I can\u2019t really ask for anything more. Now we go to Laguna trying to fight for another podium and hopefully that first win.\u201d Bradley Smith 6th\u2013 51 points : \u201cI am truely happy with this sixth place. I got a good start and I was really pleased with my pace for most of the race. It is particularly pleasing because this is a track where I expected to struggle more because it has a lot of left-hand corners and you are constantly pushing with the left part of your body. That\u2019s where my injury is but I felt strong for the whole race. I\u2019m also pleased that we managed to reduce the gap to the winner by another seven seconds and I think 25 seconds is not too bad at the moment. There were so many positives but I had a little bit of an issue with rear grip and I think we can still improve our setting to make that better. I still believe I did a really good job and now the next objective is to get closer to Bautista on the satellite Honda. This result has given me a lot of confidence and I am really looking forward to going to Laguna Seca. It is a very difficult track and while I did test there earlier this year on a production bike I am still expecting a tough weekend.\u201d  #yamaha  #yamaharacing  #motogp  #motogp2013  #sachsenring  #valentinorossi  #vr46  #calcrutchlow  #jl99  #jorgelorenzo  #bradleysmith  #germany", "replyCount": 3, "cleanContent": "Rossi Delivers in Germany for Sachsenring Podium Yamaha Factory Racing\u2019s Valentino Rossi made a welcome return to the Sachsenring podium today with third in the Motorrad Grand Prix Deutschland.

Having shown race winning pace all weekend in all conditions \u2018The Doctor\u2019 was faultless in today\u2019s TT race. The nine-time World Champion held his fourth position from the grid into the first turn then started looking for a way past Stefan Bradl for third. By the second lap he was past and with just 22 laps to go he moved past Marc Marquez into the first corner for second, beginning the hunt for Dani Pedrosa and victory. It took just one lap more and Rossi was able to dive past Pedrosa into the final chicane for a race lead he would hold to the flag, crossing the line to a sea of yellow flags and a well deserved return to form. The win puts Rossi on 85 points, now just two behind Cal Crutchlow in fourth place. While his teammate rightly deserved the honours for an amazing victory, Jorge Lorenzo also shone today. The World Champion gave everything he had and more, defying the pain from collarbone surgery just 36 hours ago in a heroic effort to race. Lorenzo had started from 12th on the grid but had risen to eighth by turn three. By the second lap he had climbed to fifth and was chasing down satellite Yamaha rider Cal Crutchlow in fourth. With 23 laps to go he had passed Crutchlow and began to close the gap to Marquez in third. As the laps wound down exhaustion set in and with 11 to go Lorenzo was re-passed by Crutchlow. With grim determination he managed to maintain pace for fifth position and rolled into the Yamaha pits to an applauding team. The remarkable feat means Lorenzo holds second in the Championship and is just nine points behind Pedrosa as they head to Sachsenring in two weeks time. Valentino Rossi 1st / 41&#39;25.202 / 26 Laps \u201cToday was something special, this is one of the best victories in my career because it is one of the most wanted and expected for such a lot of time. I\u2019m so happy because I won a real race where all my opponents were very strong and very fast, apart from Jorge with his injury. It was great from the beginning, I had a good feeling, I could overtake on braking and I felt good on the bike. It was difficult but the finish line was calling me so I had to arrive as fast as possible. We have made a step with the bike, I can ride in a better way so we have to try and stay with the top guys every weekend. Jorge rode an incredible race, we have to say a special great congratulations because he had great courage to do this and also he made an important step for his Championship.\u201d Jorge Lorenzo 5th / +15.510 / 26 Laps \u201cIt would have been impossible to believe some minutes after my crash that this could happen. We were brave to make the operation the same day, if I had waited to Friday the doctors would not have let me race. We made the race today and I was very brave in the first laps because passing the riders with a collarbone like this under braking was really hard. I felt quite good physically at the beginning of the race but after lap seven every lap was worse; it was more difficult to change direction, to brake and to accelerate so I couldn&#39;t do more than fifth position. We only lost two points to Dani who is leading the Championship. This fifth position is better than any victory I have had in my career. I hope to have a good recovery for Germany, I will not be 100% but I hope to be better than here. The victory for Valentino and the third for Crutchlow are good for the Championship, I would have preferred Cal to finish in front of Marc but you can\u2019t always have perfection! I am happy for Valentino, more than two years without winning has been hard for him so I\u2019m happy for my box partner. After Aragon I think he made some improvements and here he took profit from the opportunity. Lets see what happens in Sachsenring as last year we had some issues and the Hondas were strong but I think if I can improve my physical condition I can be more competitive than this race.\u201d Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow made a stunning return to the podium in a classic Dutch TT encounter this afternoon. The 26-lap battle was a nail-biting affair from start to finish and a fantastic charge in the second half of the race secured British rider Crutchlow a third rostrum in the last four races and ensured once again that he was unmatched as the outstanding non-factory rider. Starting from pole position for the first time in his premier class career after a sensational qualifying performance yesterday, Crutchlow found himself down in fifth place in a frenetic opening to the 65th running of the historic Dutch TT. With 90,000 fans gripped by the exciting action, Crutchlow\u2019s podium challenge commenced when he seized fourth from heroic reigning World Champion Jorge Lorenzo, who just 48 hours after breaking his left collarbone in practice was producing a superhuman effort to keep the podium in his sights early on. Crutchlow disposed of Lorenzo\u2019s threat at the final chicane on lap 15 and he then moved into the rostrum places with an identical move to get by World Championship leader Dani Pedrosa on lap 21. The former World Supersport\u2019s blistering speed then saw him brilliantly hunt down Marc Marquez for second as the race reached an enthralling climax. Eager to equal the career best second place he scored in Le Mans last month, Crutchlow came close to pulling off a thrilling overtake at the first corner on the final lap. Marquez though was not to be outdone and after coming close to contact, Crutchlow momentarily ran off track before recovering to claim a richly deserved fifth MotoGP podium that keeps him in fourth position in the World Championship standings. Bradley Smith produced yet another hugely encouraging display, the British rookie finishing inside the top 10 for the fifth race in a row. Starting alongside eventual winner Valentino Rossi and Pedrosa on the second row after a career best qualifying performance, Smith did his best to keep himself in the hunt for the top six in the early stages to try and gain vital experience from the fastest riders in the world. Struggling in the hard braking zones with discomfort from a recovery left wrist injury, Smith slipped outside of the top 10 but refused to settle for an 11th position he held from the fifth to the last lap. Locked in a battle with Nicky Hayden and Andrea Dovizioso, Smith produced a stunning last lap attack to finish ahead of both to claim ninth for the third time in the last four races. Cal Crutchlow 3rd \u2013 87 points: \u201cI am really happy to be back on the podium after the disappointment of Barcelona. It was a great battle right to the end and once again I showed my speed and I was close to finishing second and that would have matched my best result in MotoGP. But obviously after starting from pole position I wanted to win the race and had it not been for me struggling with the full fuel tank in the first five laps, I think I had a chance to fight with Valentino. I can\u2019t turn the bike on a full fuel load and then Jorge passed me and he was riding amazing considering his physical condition. It took me a while to get back by him but then I chased down Dani and Marc but it was a case of too little, too late. It was close with Marc on the last lap and I think we touched, so we were lucky he got back on the throttle when he did otherwise both of us could have been in the grandstand! Being back on the podium is great for Monster, Tech 3 and Yamaha and it is another positive result for the Championship. Before the start of the season, if somebody had said I would have been on the podium three times in seven races and been so consistently fast with the best riders in the world, then I would have been happy. Now we go to Germany in a positive frame of mind and hoping to get back on the rostrum again.\u201d Bradley Smith 9th \u2013 41 points: \u201cWith my wrist injury continuing to cause me a problem, today was probably my hardest race of the year. After the operation immediately after Catalunya I expected it to be better than the last two races but to be honest I have a few more problems now. So it was a good race and to be able to get ninth on the last lap is a good situation. The distance to Bradl was quite similar to Barcelona and truthfully this ninth feels better than the sixth I got in Barcelona because today I really had to battle and nobody crashed. The gap to the front is quite similar to Barcelona and obviously the big positive of the weekend was starting on the second row. I knew finishing seventh was going to be a best case scenario because I knew Jorge was going to be coming through. I stayed consistent and my pace in the second half of the race was strong. I still need to work on the set-up for the early laps but I can go to Germany with a lot of confidence. I\u2019ve scored another top 10 and beaten two very experienced riders on the final lap. And hopefully the wrist will be less of a problem at Germany and I can be in a bit less discomfort than here.\u201d #motogp #motogp2013  #ttassen  #yamaharacing  #yamaha  #valentinorossi  #vr46  #jorgelorenzo  #jl99  #calcrutchlow  #bradleysmith  #netherlands", "replyCount": 6, "cleanContent": "The Doctor Delivers 80th Premier Class Win at Assen Valentino Rossi delivered a faultless performance today to win the Grand Prix of The Netherlands, his 80th Premier class victory and his first win since 2010. Having shown race winning pace all weekend in all conditions \u2018The Doctor\u2019 was faultless in today\u2019s TT race. The nine-time World Champion held his fourth position from the grid into the first turn then started looking for a way past Stefan Bradl for third. By the second lap he was past and with just 22 laps to go he moved past Marc Marquez into the first corner for second, beginning the hunt for Dani Pedrosa and victory. It took just one lap more and Rossi was able to dive past Pedrosa into the final chicane for a race lead he would hold to the flag, crossing the line to a sea of yellow flags and a well deserved return to form. The win puts Rossi on 85 points, now just two behind Cal Crutchlow in fourth place. While his teammate rightly deserved the honours for an amazing victory, Jorge Lorenzo also shone today. The World Champion gave everything he had and more, defying the pain from collarbone surgery just 36 hours ago in a heroic effort to race. Lorenzo had started from 12th on the grid but had risen to eighth by turn three. By the second lap he had climbed to fifth and was chasing down satellite Yamaha rider Cal Crutchlow in fourth. With 23 laps to go he had passed Crutchlow and began to close the gap to Marquez in third. As the laps wound down exhaustion set in and with 11 to go Lorenzo was re-passed by Crutchlow. With grim determination he managed to maintain pace for fifth position and rolled into the Yamaha pits to an applauding team. The remarkable feat means Lorenzo holds second in the Championship and is just nine points behind Pedrosa as they head to Sachsenring in two weeks time. Valentino Rossi 1st / 41'25.202 / 26 Laps \u201cToday was something special, this is one of the best victories in my career because it is one of the most wanted and expected for such a lot of time. I\u2019m so happy because I won a real race where all my opponents were very strong and very fast, apart from Jorge with his injury. It was great from the beginning, I had a good feeling, I could overtake on braking and I felt good on the bike. It was difficult but the finish line was calling me so I had to arrive as fast as possible. We have made a step with the bike, I can ride in a better way so we have to try and stay with the top guys every weekend. Jorge rode an incredible race, we have to say a special great congratulations because he had great courage to do this and also he made an important step for his Championship.\u201d Jorge Lorenzo 5th / +15.510 / 26 Laps \u201cIt would have been impossible to believe some minutes after my crash that this could happen. We were brave to make the operation the same day, if I had waited to Friday the doctors would not have let me race.

The Mallorcan had dominated the morning dry session and had shown an impressive pace in the afternoon\u2019s wet practice until a huge high side at the fastest corner of the track. The first diagnosis is a left clavicle fracture which will require surgery. As a result the title challenger will miss Saturday\u2019s Dutch Grand Prix. \t\t\t\t\t Team mate Valentino Rossi&#39;s confidence in the improved set up of the YZR-M1 after the recent Spanish test continued today with the Italian nine-time champion showing a competitive pace in both the morning dry session and afternoon wet practice.

We had something important to try this afternoon in the dry but unfortunately it was wet. Anyway we continued our work in the wet and it was a good practice, we did a good job with our new setting and the bike was also very good in the wet. I improved lap by lap; I had good pace and I was in second position. We have to continue to work in both conditions, everybody knows here in Assen it can be wet or dry. Unfortunately Jorge had a big crash and an injury. It&#39;s a great pity for Yamaha, for the Team and for him as he is fighting for the Championship. I hope that he comes back as soon as possible, hopefully for the next race in Sachsenring.

We wish him the best to come back as soon as possible and stronger than before. Vale did two good practices, it seems the feeling he was looking for in the front is back.

This injury is in the background while we rule out any other major injury that may become apparent within 24 hours. These kind of impacts at more than 200 km/h need some time for the body to recover to be able to discard any other major injuries.

The British rider made a confident start to the seventh round of the 2013 campaign in cool and overcast conditions this morning and a lap of 1.35.613 placed him second on the leaderboard behind reigning World Champion Jorge Lorenzo. Crutchlow was the only rider to lap within 0.5s of Lorenzo\u2019s blistering FP1 pace and he was optimistic he could have challenged for the top three again this afternoon. Torrential rain started to hammor down on the Assen track, which hosts the only Saturday race on the MotoGP schedule, just 15 minutes before the start of FP2. Crutchlow started the session supremely confident of his potential in the rain after he raced to a career best second position on a wet track at Le Mans last month. His confidence was well placed and he led the timesheets in the final stages of the session but rather than take unnecessary risks he opted to pull into the pits and was not out on track when a host of riders improved their pace right at the end. He eventually finished seventh. \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t Today was a positive experience for Bradley Smith, the British rider producing another impressive display just 10 days after he underwent double surgery on his left hand and wrist in Barcelona. The 22-year-old had a screw inserted in the scaphoid bone in his left wrist that he damaged in a crash during practice for the recent Mugello round and while the operation was a success, he is still experiencing pain and discomfort in the hard braking zones at Assen. Smith was immediately fast on his YZR-M1 machine in FP1 though and a personal best lap of 1.37.002 placed him 10th and just over a second outside of the top three. With FP2 a rain-soaked affair and with further wet weather forecast for tomorrow, Smith\u2019s outstanding effort to finish in the top 10 this morning could have earned him a deserved place in tomorrow afternoon\u2019s QP2. \t\t\t\t\t Cal Crutchlow 2nd / 1&#39;35.613 / 38 laps \u201cI am really happy with today. I was second in the dry this morning although I need to improve my pace in the first sector because the gap to Lorenzo in that section was pretty big. The gap of everybody else was pretty big to be fair and Jorge was doing an amazing job. It\u2019s a huge shame that he got injured in FP2 and I wish him a speedy recovery because the Championship is not the same with him not in it. In the rain this afternoon I was very comfortable and I am one of the fastest on track. Before the end of the session I didn\u2019t want to take any risks so I came into the pits and lost a few places. Had I stayed out I am sure I could have been in the top three again but I am happy enough with my performance in both conditions.\u201d  #yamaharacing  #motogp2013  #motogp #jorgelorenzo #valentinorossi  #jl99  #vr46  #calcrutchlow  #monsterenergy  #ttassen", "replyCount": 2, "cleanContent": "Disaster for Lorenzo Whilst Rossi Finds Form in Assen Despite being the fastest rider in the first day of practice today, the Assen TT proved again to be a disaster for the third year running for current World Champion Jorge Lorenzo.

His confidence was well placed and he led the timesheets in the final stages of the session but rather than take unnecessary risks he opted to pull into the pits and was not out on track when a host of riders improved their pace right at the end. He eventually finished seventh. Today was a positive experience for Bradley Smith, the British rider producing another impressive display just 10 days after he underwent double surgery on his left hand and wrist in Barcelona. The 22-year-old had a screw inserted in the scaphoid bone in his left wrist that he damaged in a crash during practice for the recent Mugello round and while the operation was a success, he is still experiencing pain and discomfort in the hard braking zones at Assen. Smith was immediately fast on his YZR-M1 machine in FP1 though and a personal best lap of 1.37.002 placed him 10th and just over a second outside of the top three. With FP2 a rain-soaked affair and with further wet weather forecast for tomorrow, Smith\u2019s outstanding effort to finish in the top 10 this morning could have earned him a deserved place in tomorrow afternoon\u2019s QP2. Cal Crutchlow 2nd / 1'35.613 / 38 laps \u201cI am really happy with today. I was second in the dry this morning although I need to improve my pace in the first sector because the gap to Lorenzo in that section was pretty big. The gap of everybody else was pretty big to be fair and Jorge was doing an amazing job. It\u2019s a huge shame that he got injured in FP2 and I wish him a speedy recovery because the Championship is not the same with him not in it. In the rain this afternoon I was very comfortable and I am one of the fastest on track. Before the end of the session I didn\u2019t want to take any risks so I came into the pits and lost a few places. Had I stayed out I am sure I could have been in the top three again but I am happy enough with my performance in both conditions.\u201d #yamaharacing #motogp2013 #motogp #jorgelorenzo #valentinorossi #jl99 #vr46 #calcrutchlow #monsterenergy #ttassen", "sentiment_score": 0.04033688524590165, "postID": "z12ysbew1m3sjxo2k22dynrr3kbhvbj0t"}
