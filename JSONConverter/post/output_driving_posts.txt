This research has been applied to intergroup attitudes showing that an induced emotion will only affect intergroup attitudes if it is relevant to stereotypes. As intergroup processes for gender groups differ from those for ethnic groups, the effect of anger differs.

The aim of this research was to examine the online and offline equivalence of a commonly employed measure of gender role orientation: the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) short-form. Researchers have generally found that online versions of traditional pen and paper tests are equivalent. However, although many measures have been deemed equivalent, the equivalence of online and offline tests cannot be assumed. Participants (n = 372) completed the BSRI short-form either online (n = 244) or offline (n = 128). Equivalence was assessed through reliability measures and mean differences. There was no significant difference between femininity scores depending on mode of administration. However, masculinity scores were significantly higher when the BSRI short-form was administered offline.\u00a0 There are several possible explanations for why masculinity scores differ depending on administration mode. For example, it is feasible that conceptualisations of masculinity might be different in online and offline environments. Another possible explanation is that participants were responding in a socially desirable manner when responding offline due to perceptions of decreased anonymity and subsequent identifiability of data. It has been argued that computers create an impersonal social situation in which individuals feel more anonymous and less concerned about how they appear to others. The reason why only the masculinity scale performed differently online is unclear. An additional and unexpected finding was that there was no significant difference between men and women\u2019s masculinity scores. Previous research has found a decrease in sex differences on the BSRI masculinity scale, leading the author to suggest that men and women have become similar in their responses to masculine personality traits.

Unfortunately I was addicted to them before they were pulled from production; so now, I have a permanent craving for the things. So people back me up here, lets start a revolution to bring back the jellies! #BringBackTheJellies", "sentiment_score": 0.10438383838383838, "postID": "z13qcpzz0uz4spl1i22bitoahqiczfy0z"}

Look...we have the internet, videos, affidavits, full transcripts precisely \"at the tip of our fingers\"; so don't try to clip videos and tell me something happened which I can research for myself, didn't happen. Yet again, the big lib outlets of media have clipped a video to try and propagandize the public into believing their rivals (the gun clinging right wing nuts) are evil, disrespectful, heartless, demons. When the conservative media does the same thing I am just as angry about it, however, can you truthfully say that recently you have seen a conservative media outlet try and intentionally betray their journalistic integrity by manipulating videos to try and outrage the public by portraying the situation as something it wasn't (or was even the opposite)? The incident I speak of is the liberal media (msnbc, huffington post, etc.) coverage of the Gun Violence prevention hearing in a Connecticut legislative meeting. MSNBC would have you believe that a grieving father was heckled by \"second amendment crazies\" when he brought up a question about gun control. But when you watch the full UNEDITED video, it is apparent he asked \"I ask if there\u2019s anybody in this room that can give me one reason or challenge this question \u2026 why anybody in this room needs to have one of these assault-style weapons or military weapons or high-capacity clips.\" and someone simply answered him by saying \"... Second Amendment shall not be infringed\". Watch for yourself and tell me if they were \"heckling him\" or \"answering him\". You be the judge. (Fast forward to exactly 15 minutes in to see said controversy.)

The root word of &#39;enforcement&#39; is &#39;force&#39;, and that got me thinking about the different types of force. I came up with four, and each one leads from a state of more freedom to less. Patriotism: If someone is loyal to the cause of their own free will, the force comes from self instead of externally. Incentive: There are different levels of incentive from deserved reward to being a mercenary for hire. Regardless, when it is expected that in order to have a task done, someone expects reward, you are free to either get rewarded or not; there is no one forcing you to do so. (Cash for clunkers is a good example) Coercion: Simply put, this is the concept of &quot;Do this or else....&quot; You are still somewhat free to disobey, but there is a consequence if you you are caught. Fear is the prime motivator. Brute Force: There is no choice in the matter. Someone with power oversees someone with less power to make them do what they wish to be done. The very definition of slavery. Out of all of these ways, the bottom three are the only way the executive branch can &#39;enforce&#39; laws on someone who may not follow their sympathies; and out of those three, Coercion can only be used when a majority agrees with the cause, otherwise the majority cannot be coerced by the minority. Which in the case of big disputes only leaves two options: Incentive and Brute Force. So here is the scary thought. If the government is out of money, they can&#39;t incentivize anybody. So that only leaves one option, brute force. The US is so deeply steeped in debt they have no money, and I know some of these policies being thrown around right now are not agreed upon by any majority (in fact they use the mob rule card to try to guilt people into neutrality). So don&#39;t be surprised if someone comes to your door one day with a fully automatic weapon or a tank behind them and demands compliance, because the patriots to their own cause have no other choice.

They had a good sample of different kinds if firearms (two of them are police officers). I fired revolvers, pistols, and Assault Rifles. I was trying to see if there was a firearm (if any) that I felt comfortable enough with that I might actually purchase one. I have never owned a gun, but I have taken safety classes, gone hunting, and used my friend&#39;s guns growing up. It dawned on me there, the insidious nature of the current gun control controversy. Each weapon I used was semi-automatic. Each weapon I used had high-power ammunition. Everything but the revolver took only a few seconds to re-load (although, there are ways to increase load time for revolvers as well). Yet, out of all of them, the assault rifle is the least likely to kill you if you were hit by it. The assault rifle uses high velocity rounds and is intended for distance and penetration; the bullet would more than likely pass right through you, whereas if you were hit by a pistol with hollow point rounds or a shot gun, you would be turned into a pile of goo. You can buy magazines with just as many rounds (or more) than an assault rifle can carry, for other weapons. So why try to ban assault rifles? It can&#39;t be just because they look intimidating, any gun is scary looking. Our politicians are crafty, they are logically minded and very smart; you may want to question that at times, but that is to their advantage. Like poker, politics is is often a game of not letting your opponents know what hand you hold; at the same time you must figure out the true intentions of your rival by the moves they make. A &quot;bluff&quot; is a fake move intended to trick your opponent into thinking your hand is either more powerful or less powerful depending on which gives you the greater advantage. You may want your opponent to think your hand is weak when it is not if you want them to push more money into the pot, or you may want them to think you have a strong hand when you don&#39;t so they will quit before you have to show them you probably couldn&#39;t have won in the first place. The assault rifle focus is a weak bluff, and to explain I will give you some history. In 1997 there was a bank robbery in North Hollywood by two people wearing full body armor firing automatic weapons with seemingly endless amounts of ammunition. At the end of the shootout, 18 people were injured (mostly police officers) and the two robbers were dead. The situation lasted nearly an hour because police ammunition could not penetrate the body armor of the robbers. The criminals had acquired the weapons they used illegally (both had previous criminal records and had recently committed similar robberies). With just a little know-how, they had modified legal semi-automatic weapons to fire automatically. This very incident was key in creating two major changes in law and law enforcement: The push for magazines to only allow 10 rounds or less; and the police force to have body armor, armored car doors, and carry armor piercing weapons/ammunition as standard equipment. These changes were made to create equality in power, so that the police had equal footing and deter future similar criminal activity. I say this is both insidious and a weak bluff, because the push to remove assault rifles from the hands of civilians can mean only one thing: To unbalance the power that law enforcers have over civilians. If civilians do not have the same power to defend themselves as say...A MILITIA has, then a heavily armored militia with armor piecing rounds has the power to suppress citizens without a balance of populous power to keep that militia in check. It is a weak bluff because the tables are equal currently, and lawmakers are trying to convince you it is a good idea to give up your assault rifles because it will make everybody safer. If you fold now, they immediately have more power over you. Equality becomes oppression. Scary thought, huh?

Fitzgerald Carryl was pulled over and police found a gun in his car. When the attempted to arrest him, he reached for an officer&#39;s weapon. It&#39;s unclear but it seems he put his hand on the gun but was not able to unholster the weapon. He pled to attempted theft, illegal possession of a firearm and reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon. The maximum sentence is 5 years on each of these 3 charges. Since they all emerged from the same episode, the sentences are normally concurrent. The maximum sentence should then be 5 years. But this judge in particular has grown quite fond of imposing consecutive sentences for multiple counts arising from the same course of conduct. Imposing sentences in this way allows the defendant to receive a total sentence that would otherwise be illegal. In this case, Carryl got 3.5 years on the illegal possession and a consecutive 5 on the remaining 2 charges. Under some circumstances, Maine law allows this. Though I was not in court for the sentencing, I guarantee Judge Moskowitz said something about his favorite case State v.

He pled to attempted theft, illegal possession of a firearm and reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon. The maximum sentence is 5 years on each of these 3 charges. Since they all emerged from the same episode, the sentences are normally concurrent. The maximum sentence should then be 5 years. But this judge in particular has grown quite fond of imposing consecutive sentences for multiple counts arising from the same course of conduct. Imposing sentences in this way allows the defendant to receive a total sentence that would otherwise be illegal. In this case, Carryl got 3.5 years on the illegal possession and a consecutive 5 on the remaining 2 charges. Under some circumstances, Maine law allows this. Though I was not in court for the sentencing, I guarantee Judge Moskowitz said something about his favorite case State v. Winchenbach , the leading opinion in support these sentences.

When I fall out of exercise, due to illness or injury or disruption from things going on in my life, it\u2019s hard to get started again. I don\u2019t even feel like thinking about it, sometimes. But I\u2019ve always found a way to break out of that slump, and here are some things I\u2019ve learned that have helped: One Goal. Whenever I\u2019ve been in a slump, I\u2019ve discovered that it\u2019s often because I have too much going on in my life. I\u2019m trying to do too much. And it saps my energy and motivation. It\u2019s probably the most common mistake that people make: they try to take on too much, try to accomplish too many goals at once. You cannot maintain energy and focus (the two most important things in accomplishing a goal) if you are trying to do two or more goals at once. It\u2019s not possible \u2014 I\u2019ve tried it many times. You have to choose one goal, for now, and focus on it completely. I know, that\u2019s hard. Still, I speak from experience. You can always do your other goals when you\u2019ve accomplished your One Goal. Find inspiration. Inspiration, for me, comes from others who have achieved what I want to achieve, or who are currently doing it. I read other blogs, books, magazines. I Google my goal, and read success stories. Zen Habits is just one place for inspiration, not only from me but from many readers who have achieved amazing things. Get excited. This sounds obvious, but most people don\u2019t think about it much: if you want to break out of a slump, get yourself excited about a goal. But how can you do that when you don\u2019t feel motivated? Well, it starts with inspiration from others (see above), but you have to take that excitement and build on it. For me, I\u2019ve learned that by talking to my wife about it, and to others, and reading as much about it as possible, and visualizing what it would be like to be successful (seeing the benefits of the goal in my head), I get excited about a goal. Once I\u2019ve done that, it\u2019s just a matter of carrying that energy forward and keeping it going. Build anticipation. This will sound hard, and many people will skip this tip. But it really works. It helped me quit smoking after many failed attempts. If you find inspiration and want to do a goal, don\u2019t start right away. Many of us will get excited and want to start today. That\u2019s a mistake. Set a date in the future \u2014 a week or two, or even a month \u2014 and make that your Start Date. Mark it on the calendar. Get excited about that date. Make it the most important date in your life. In the meantime, start writing out a plan. And do some of the steps below. Because by delaying your start, you are building anticipation, and increasing your focus and energy for your goal. Post your goal. Print out your goal in big words. Make your goal just a few words long, like a mantra (\u201cExercise 15 mins. Daily\u201d), and post it up on your wall or refrigerator. Post it at home and work. Put it on your computer desktop. You want to have big reminders about your goal, to keep your focus and keep your excitement going. A picture of your goal (like a model with sexy abs, for example) also helps. Commit publicly. None of us likes to look bad in front of others. We will go the extra mile to do something we\u2019ve said publicly. For example, when I wanted to run my first marathon, I started writing a column about it in my local daily newspaper. The entire island of Guam (pop. 160K) knew about my goal. I couldn\u2019t back down, and even though my motivation came and went, I stuck with it and completed it. Now, you don\u2019t have to commit to your goal in your daily newspaper, but you can do it with friends and family and co-workers, and you can do it on your blog if you have one. And hold yourself accountable \u2014 don\u2019t just commit once, but commit to giving progress updates to everyone every week or so. Think about it daily. If you think about your goal every day, it is much more likely to become true. To this end, posting the goal on your wall or computer desktop (as mentioned above) helps a lot. Sending yourself daily reminders also helps. And if you can commit to doing one small thing to further your goal (even just 5 minutes) every single day, your goal will almost certainly come true. Get support. It\u2019s hard to accomplish something alone. When I decided to run my marathon, I had the help of friends and family, and I had a great running community on Guam who encouraged me at 5K races and did long runs with me. When I decided to quit smoking, I joined an online forum and that helped tremendously. And of course, my wife Eva helped every step of the way. I couldn\u2019t have done these goals without her, or without the others who supported me. Find your support network, either in the real world or online, or both. Realize that there\u2019s an ebb and flow. Motivation is not a constant thing that is always there for you. It comes and goes, and comes and goes again, like the tide. But realize that while it may go away, it doesn\u2019t do so permanently. It will come back. Just stick it out and wait for that motivation to come back. In the meantime, read about your goal (see below), ask for help (see below), and do some of the other things listed here until your motivation comes back. Stick with it. Whatever you do, don\u2019t give up. Even if you aren\u2019t feeling any motivation today, or this week, don\u2019t give up. Again, that motivation will come back. Think of your goal as a long journey, and your slump is just a little bump in the road. You can\u2019t give up with every little bump. Stay with it for the long term, ride out the ebbs and surf on the flows, and you\u2019ll get there. Start small. Really small. If you are having a hard time getting started, it may be because you\u2019re thinking too big. If you want to exercise, for example, you may be thinking that you have to do these intense workouts 5 days a week. No \u2014 instead, do small, tiny, baby steps. Just do 2 minutes of exercise. I know, that sounds wimpy. But it works. Commit to 2 minutes of exercise for one week. You may want to do more, but just stick to 2 minutes. It\u2019s so easy, you can\u2019t fail. Do it at the same time, every day. Just some crunches, 2 pushups, and some jogging in place. Once you\u2019ve done 2 minutes a day for a week, increase it to 5, and stick with that for a week. In a month, you\u2019ll be doing 15-20. Want to wake up early? Don\u2019t think about waking at 5 a.m. Instead, think about waking 10 minutes earlier for a week. That\u2019s all. Once you\u2019ve done that, wake 10 minutes earlier than that. Baby steps. Build on small successes. Again, if you start small for a week, you\u2019re going to be successful. You can\u2019t fail if you start with something ridiculously easy. Who can\u2019t exercise for 2 minutes? (If that\u2019s you, I apologize.) And you\u2019ll feel successful, and good about yourself. Take that successful feeling and build on it, with another baby step. Add 2-3 minutes to your exercise routine, for example. With each step (and each step should last about a week), you will feel even more successful. Make each step really, really small, and you won\u2019t fail. After a couple of months, your tiny steps will add up to a lot of progress and a lot of success. Read about it daily. When I lose motivation, I just read a book or blog about my goal. It inspires me and reinvigorates me. For some reason, reading helps motivate and focus you on whatever you\u2019re reading about. So read about your goal every day, if you can, especially when you\u2019re not feeling motivated. Call for help when your motivation ebbs. Having trouble? Ask for help. Email me. Join an online forum. Get a partner to join you. Call your mom. It doesn\u2019t matter who, just tell them your problems, and talking about it will help. Ask them for advice. Ask them to help you overcome your slump. It works. Think about the benefits, not the difficulties. One common problem is that we think about how hard something is. Exercise sounds so hard! Just thinking about it makes you tired. But instead of thinking about how hard something is, think about what you will get out of it. For example, instead of thinking about how tiring exercise can be, focus on how good you\u2019ll feel when you\u2019re done, and how you\u2019ll be healthier and slimmer over the long run. The benefits of something will help energize you. Squash negative thoughts; replace them with positive ones. Along those lines, it\u2019s important to start monitoring your thoughts. Recognize negative self-talk, which is really what\u2019s causing your slump. Just spend a few days becoming aware of every negative thought. Then, after a few days, try squashing those negative thoughts like a bug, and then replacing them with a corresponding positive thought. Squash, \u201cThis is too hard!\u201d and replace it with, \u201cI can do this! If that wimp Leo can do it, so can I!\u201d It sounds corny, but it works. Really. http://zenhabits.net/get-off-your-butt-16-ways-to-get-motivated-when-youre-in-a-slump/", "replyCount": 0, "cleanContent": "Get Off Your Butt: 16 Ways to Get Motivated When You\u2019re in a Slump Post written by Leo Babauta. When I fall out of exercise, due to illness or injury or disruption from things going on in my life, it\u2019s hard to get started again. I don\u2019t even feel like thinking about it, sometimes. But I\u2019ve always found a way to break out of that slump, and here are some things I\u2019ve learned that have helped: One Goal. Whenever I\u2019ve been in a slump, I\u2019ve discovered that it\u2019s often because I have too much going on in my life. I\u2019m trying to do too much. And it saps my energy and motivation. It\u2019s probably the most common mistake that people make: they try to take on too much, try to accomplish too many goals at once. You cannot maintain energy and focus (the two most important things in accomplishing a goal) if you are trying to do two or more goals at once. It\u2019s not possible \u2014 I\u2019ve tried it many times. You have to choose one goal, for now, and focus on it completely. I know, that\u2019s hard. Still, I speak from experience. You can always do your other goals when you\u2019ve accomplished your One Goal. Find inspiration. Inspiration, for me, comes from others who have achieved what I want to achieve, or who are currently doing it. I read other blogs, books, magazines. I Google my goal, and read success stories. Zen Habits is just one place for inspiration, not only from me but from many readers who have achieved amazing things. Get excited. This sounds obvious, but most people don\u2019t think about it much: if you want to break out of a slump, get yourself excited about a goal. But how can you do that when you don\u2019t feel motivated? Well, it starts with inspiration from others (see above), but you have to take that excitement and build on it. For me, I\u2019ve learned that by talking to my wife about it, and to others, and reading as much about it as possible, and visualizing what it would be like to be successful (seeing the benefits of the goal in my head), I get excited about a goal. Once I\u2019ve done that, it\u2019s just a matter of carrying that energy forward and keeping it going. Build anticipation. This will sound hard, and many people will skip this tip. But it really works. It helped me quit smoking after many failed attempts. If you find inspiration and want to do a goal, don\u2019t start right away. Many of us will get excited and want to start today. That\u2019s a mistake. Set a date in the future \u2014 a week or two, or even a month \u2014 and make that your Start Date. Mark it on the calendar. Get excited about that date. Make it the most important date in your life. In the meantime, start writing out a plan. And do some of the steps below. Because by delaying your start, you are building anticipation, and increasing your focus and energy for your goal. Post your goal. Print out your goal in big words. Make your goal just a few words long, like a mantra (\u201cExercise 15 mins. Daily\u201d), and post it up on your wall or refrigerator. Post it at home and work. Put it on your computer desktop. You want to have big reminders about your goal, to keep your focus and keep your excitement going. A picture of your goal (like a model with sexy abs, for example) also helps. Commit publicly.

Professor Ilya Strebulaev shares four areas to research: 1. Number of Partners Typically the VC who leads your Series A round will take a board seat at your company. How many companies do they have in their portfolio? Which partner do you want on your board? How many boards do they sit on? How much time will your company get with the VC?\u00a0 2. Stage Early stage deals are much smaller, so VC funds are smaller. In 2004-2005, the median-sized Series A round was $1 million. Now we\u2019re seeing $2.5 million Series A rounds because of angel investors and incubators/accelerators. Does the VC specialize in a specific stage of a company\u2019s development? What is the deal size of their recent investments? 3.

With my pack on and all my camera gear I was huffing and puffing going up some of the steep parts of the trail that leads to Grand Park. When I got up there I could tell that it was too early. There were some wildflowers but not much. The worse part was that I got up at about 4:30 AM for sunrise to at least gets some shots of Rainier but it was overcast and I couldn&#39;t see the mountain at all even though it was right there. There wasn&#39;t even a cool fog over the trees. Just grayness. I did see a herd of about 30 elk so that was pretty cool. So the pictures of the wildflowers was a bust but I did get a nice shot of Eleanor Creek and the adventure part of backpacking is always fun.

I hadn&#39;t been to there yet so when I arrived I was surprised to see the parking lot pretty empty. I figured there would be a bunch of photographers as this was Yosemite and there also seems to be a lot of photographers about. I circled around the parking lot, which has two tiers, and as I got to the upper tier I noticed something moseying about. I stopped for a closer look and it was a black bear. I would think you&#39;d see a black bear in the valley but not up here. So, I went down to the lower parking lot and as I drove closer he kind of ran off. As I made the loop to the upper tier I see him come out again and walk up to a parked SUV, get on his hind legs, and peek into the back. I had seen videos of Yosemite bears doing this but it was pretty funny to see in person. The bear didn&#39;t do anything to the car so that was good.

I hadn't been to there yet so when I arrived I was surprised to see the parking lot pretty empty. I figured there would be a bunch of photographers as this was Yosemite and there also seems to be a lot of photographers about. I circled around the parking lot, which has two tiers, and as I got to the upper tier I noticed something moseying about. I stopped for a closer look and it was a black bear. I would think you'd see a black bear in the valley but not up here. So, I went down to the lower parking lot and as I drove closer he kind of ran off. As I made the loop to the upper tier I see him come out again and walk up to a parked SUV, get on his hind legs, and peek into the back. I had seen videos of Yosemite bears doing this but it was pretty funny to see in person. The bear didn't do anything to the car so that was good.
