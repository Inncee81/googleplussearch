A new MINI Connected package features various in-car technologies and innovative driver assists for added comfort and safety. A head-up display will feature on the new MINI, which projects information such as driving speed, speed limit and navigation instructions onto a small retractable screen. For added safety a new collision and pedestrian warning system with city brake function will be offered. It uses a windscreen-mounted camera to detect pedestrians and vehicles, which if deemed to be too close, provides audible and visual warnings to alter the driver. If the driver fails to respond, the car will automatically brake preventing a collision. Other #tech includes the MINI parking assist with reversing camera and headlights that automatically adjust themselves depending on driving and traffic conditions. Windscreen-mounted cameras again monitor oncoming vehicles and pedestrians and automatically switch to dimmed headlights to avoid causing a nuisance to other road users. Another first for the MINI is the video-based active speed and distance control, which helps the MINI maintain a safe distance from the car in front by varying the cars speed. There\u2019s also a traffic sign memory function and a no passing display. The MINI will make simultaneous global debuts at the LA and Tokyo Motor Shows as well as a special event in Shanghai after its UK reveal on 18 November.
